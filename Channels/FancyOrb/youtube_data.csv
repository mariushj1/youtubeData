xtzSv1YOLLI,Rust Last to Leave the Circle Wins $400.00,770817,15782,852,0 days 00:50:33,this is a social experiment where i gathered eight players and put them in a circle the last person to leave it wins $400 this is like the game show survivor it's a game that tests your social skills because politics will take place alliances will form and i'll be playing psychological mind tricks that will push the players to their limits in fact there's a button outside this circle and once they activate it in 5 minutes it'll start to cause chaos in the circle also if you haven't already join me on my journey and getting a million subscribers by the end of the year now before the challenge starts i'm allowing all the players to select one item of they're choosing to help them in this challenge they can choose entertainment since they'll be stuck in there for hours or they can choose something more strategic like meds because in this circle there's three ways to be eliminated first the obvious stepping out the circle the second way is dying at any point in the circle and finally every 1 hour an elimination challenge is held where if you fail you're eliminated so let's go see what the players choose for their first item everyone line up we're going to do items i would like a cory bez welcome back to the circle this is your second time i want a bradley chr all right bez what' you get that's not bad i want to see four can i get a supply signal hopefully this lands in the circle yeah hopefully all right i will take a flashbang all right let me get an admin car ot liam we actually have our first ot representative joining the circle i need to play to my strengths here i need the ak now ot liam is a member of oil team which is the best clan in rust this clan is known for having the best pvpers in this game and having liam in the circle already makes him a big target everyone knows he's the best pvper in this challenge so it might encourage people to form teams against him we have brao welcome back to the circle your third time today br for now can i just get a high external stone gate br here is a legend in the circle series in the circle series lore braal has made it to the final two not once but twice one challenge away from winning the prize but fumbled the bag both times i'm happy for you mana congratulations so this is bra's third time joining a circle video he's experienced he knows how to survive till the end so it could also make him a big threat as well all right now the challenge has officially started if you step out of the circle you're eliminated and every 1 hour we'll do an elimination challenge and you'll be eliminated are you guys ready yes sir but unfortunately i have to tell you guys something right now what uh there will be one person eliminated right now we're about to do our first elimination challenge so everyone please gather in the middle guys for the first challenge you all will be given pogo sticks these pogo sticks are very hard to control and they're boosted so it makes you jump higher you must stay inside the circle while bouncing and the first person to lose control and bounce out the circle first is eliminated i've never used the i've never used it either dude that's so bad all right players equip your pogo sticks and start jumping this challenge is now on oh a this is already terrible i'm going forward players are starting to move now i see everyone jumping people are losing control dude i'm so aer is really losing control aer needs to get it together now aer was the first one to bounce out the circle everyone else is save oh my god that was quick oh my god that was scary and if the contestants thought that was scary there's still six more elimination challenges they'll have to survive if they want to win the $400 prize gl you were first damn wish i would have lasted a little longer had some great ideas great plans this pogo stick is uh garbage out of everyone in that circle who do you think is going to win this challenge bra's going to fumble the bag and kez is going to somehow win now it was time for aer to leave the server but it was time for me to reveal the final challenge that will be happening later in this event at the end of the challenge so when it comes down to the final two i'm going to bring everyone back in and we're going to do a vote so eventually you'll be brought back in are you would you be down for that later sure so in the final elimination challenge where there's only two people left from the circle all eliminated players will get to come back and vote on the winner the players in the circle have no idea so however they play could determine if they win in the end if they're being toxic or making enemies it could backstab them later in the event because no one would vote for them as the winner so it'll be interesting to watch how these players compete not knowing that this will happen later in the video all right congratulations everyone that the first person elimin how we feeling uh those poo sticks are yours to keep those are very risky if you do jump out of the circle with those you are eliminated so now since we had our first elimination i think it's time to introduce the players to the button but i want to show you guys something do you guys see this right here this what's the button about this is going to be a new addition to uh the circle video guys what's going to happen is i'm going to start the switch what and right now that calendar is counting it'll count to 60 and if it counts to 60 an alarm will go off and that means you guys will have a punishment in order to reset the timer you press the button and it goes back to zero but if at any point this timer and alarm goes off to 60 seconds there will be punishments activated and all so boom you just reset the timer good job bz good job yeah no problem so that means one of you guys will have to reset this so don't don't forget that now although it seemed like an easy task this button would soon start to cause conflict so it's all in our collective interest and never let this exactly it is collective interest for that to not go past 60 or else everyone suffers wait wait check the timer bu timer 30 seconds what if someone decides to sabotage it you might at 59 huh you might want two people you know cuz someone might want to like sabotage it and let it go to 60 the contestants had to figure out how they were going to keep this button below 60 seconds they could take shifts one at a time but what if someone's not paying attention and they forget they could go in order and form a line but that takes too much brain power this button would cause a lot of stress knowing a punishment could happen if they missed the timer all right uh i need everyone to come over here and look at me real quick i have a little announcement that i want to show you i've been making videos ever since 2015 in fact you can still see my very first video i uploaded 8 years ago all right what's going on guys fancy up here now throughout these 8 years you've seen my content drastically change and improve all under the fans you are branding from things like simple random farming videos give me random items in this game then bigger 100 player experiments currently there are 125 players on this map to go on to make massive community events endorsed by face punch themselves we've come a long way under the fancy orb brand and for the very first time my fancy orb character has come to life you has been a dream sponsor mind ever since i was a kid and my blue character all dressed up is now in the form of a plush now who knows where this ch channel will be at years from now i could be at 2 million subs 5 million you getting this youtube will mark your loyalty as a viewer by getting the first collectible of this channel this is my first pizza of merchandise ever and it will never be available again it's only available for 14 days at $30 and if you aren't able to buy one that is completely understandable especially in today's crazy world you watching this video already supports me enough and if you do decide to get a fancy or beos please send me a screenshot in my discord so i can personally thank you i rarely do sponsors but this one is special to me so let's get back into the video contestant doc threw his supply signal that he chose as his item at the start but the funny thing is there's still a chance it could land outside the circle and be completely wasted but it did provide temporary entertainment for the circle not right put it in the middle like as possible so no i think i think that's landing in the circle for sure i'm like standing right under it it looks like i i think i think oh that's 100% out holy yeah no you're trolling me that's definitely out out oh no we're sting out yeah oh my god they got to 55 did it get to 55 guys do not forget the timer there needs to be two people on that and it all ended up being for nothing that is actually far out and just to rub it in his face a little more i told doc he could have had a c4 two guns some armor and ammunition what damn that's a good air drop though all right uh now that i know there are teams going i'm going to grab a couple of you guys for interviews so apparently there's some teaming going on are you in any teams right now liam no i feel okay i'm not going to lie i'm kind of worried uh you put me on a pogo stick kind of role play for me i was kind of worried i don't know i'm be able to stay alive much longer but so you're you're soloing this by yourself yeah i don't plan on teaming with anyone honestly i actually am cool with the punishment i'm not pressing the button oh i'm hoping that goes by look they look pretty distracted right now may be lucky now now ot liam is like the lone wolf of this group he knows he's the biggest target and because of that he's refusing to press the button this causes tension in the circle now because it's one last person to help avoid punishments for the entire circle if the button reaches 60 seconds hello are you in any teams right now what's going on yeah i'm just kind of snooping about right now i'm alliance are alliance will help in the beginning but you know at the end there has to be one winner so r here knows the reality of the circle these alliances being made will eventually fail because there can only be one winner bra has had many alliances in past circle videos betray and fall apart so he's a season veteran when it comes to this but then i interviewed freek who would tell me some important intel i figured something out bjor just 100% trying to get that timer to run out oh really at 56 seconds there was another player named b george who also refused to press the button now there were politics starting to form in the circle all because of the small little button are you working with any teams right now b george not at all it is just me versus the world what do you think about that button over there do you have any opinions on that button i'm going let that button hit 60 seconds i got caught staring at it a 56 and then pushed it so there are two people who are lone wolfes refusing to press the button ot liam and b george while everyone else is working together to press the button and keep punishments out of the circle these two don't care and would rather have chaos now although be george and liam said they're lone wolves they might start an alliance together because they have a common goal in mind time went to 56 seconds while you were doing yeah i heard uh i heard it got very close honestly i think george just wants to see the world burn is that true george everyone's kind of blaming you here to not press the button what's going on it was looking right out of he's being a bit meliss i am curious what happens but like so dark i think everyone's curious but i don't think it's a curious you want to find out you know why don't we just why don't we just make a line and we just all like go through and just press press go to the back of line i like how this button is is causing politics everyone's lining up except for ot liam and b george not lining up the punishment oh i'm fine with the punishment b george and liam are the only two ones okay look at them standing next to each other like doesn't look fuss that looks a little sus bro and right here is where i see the definite teams the good guys who are contributing their due diligence by pressing the button and taking turns and the bad guys who are off to the side not helping the circle but remember what i said to the first contest who was eliminated so when it comes down to the final 2 i'm going to bring everyone back in and we're going to do a vote you'll choose the winner eventually at the end all contestants who were eliminated will vote together on the winner and these actions might cause b george and liam to lose votes if they get to the final two nah bro they're definitely in quick chat right now these guys are on their villain arc right now team dn solo man it was 5 minutes before the next elimination challenge and the players were heavily considering letting the button hit 60 before the challenge why we get three people oh my god oh my god dude i thought you guys were going to do it i thought you guys were going to do it because the elimination challenge was about to happen the players are thinking it would be more strategic to let the button hit 60 before the challenge i'm not going to lie it's kind how bad could it be i kind of want it to happen it kind all of us it's entertainment it's ent all right guys honestly like do we just figure it out now so it doesn't happen later exactly we sp it it stacks it stacks it's a new punishment every time so once the first punishment happens or if it does the clock is going to reset and like you'll have to keep worrying about this i don't want to let it go let's see what happens let's see what happens i want to click it if you want to click it click it if you want to click it i don't i don't want to know what happens no no let's do it li press the button liam i thought elimination ot liam for the first time clicked the button it showed me that there was still fear in the back of everyone's head on what would happen if the timer hit 60 seconds just this once just this once i'm pressing it after the challenge it's in like 5 minutes then now i'm going back to team not pressing the button guys ready for the second elimination challenge one of you will be eliminated after 1 hour of being in this circle for the second elimination challenge you all will be receiving a molotov there's an npc outside this circle that you must kill with your molotov but you have to aim it so the fire spreads and burns onto your npc and kills it if you miss you go back to line and start over the last person to kill their npc is eliminated from this challenge oh no dude that is tough bro also for elimination challenges the button is temporarily turned off since the contestants need to compete in the challenge br wants to go first let's get a line let's get a line go next all right first up is going to be bral you can throw when you're ready br does not kill the npc bra is at risk of being eliminated all right for the air drop oh he gotc also misses okay okay that is a kill tech is safe you can go ahead and sit over on the couch you are not being eliminated bez misses be georger short too kezza is also short oh my everyone was failing this challenge except for freet tech but it was ot liam's turn who had a different strategy for this challenge dude he's doing a lineup what are you doing right now is this going to work ot liam was using his ak item to his advantage to line up the angle to throw his molotov no oh no way but he still misses oh oh gets the npc doc gets it sir b george kills the npc he is safe it was now down to three players contestant kzo was about to go up next but little did he know b george was going to use his item to ruin his chances of being safe all right buta you can throw it when you're ready oh oh i just dro what happened there a flashbang went off flash that someone george just used a flashbang to mess up kezza what the gets it going liam gets itza i'm so sorry my friend kezza was now eliminated all thanks to b george everyone everyone gather around kezza please it's time for for him let's go over here ot liam recognized what b george had just done and this would prove to everyone in the circle that alliances are crucial to survive kezza it is time for you to leave the circle and right before kezza left he quickly dropped the c4 item he chose earlier and gave it to bra in hopes no one would pick it up before him hez i'll do it time to get your interview let's go to the interview room you are unfortunately eliminated how are you feeling at the end of the day we all know what needs to happen today r's got to take home the dub no matter what happens i got to get out of there at some point when it gets to the final two people uh what i want to do is bring everyone who is eliminated back and you will be voting whoever is the final two in there so i can be around i can be around congratulations you guys have survived that elimination challenge all right everyone everyone line up we're going to do items and then i'm resetting the timer after every elimination challenge the players get to select one new item they want in the circle i'd like a key key lock here's your key you luck thank you oh my god he he did volunteer to go first so fre tech placed a lock on the gate which means only he can open it which gives him a huge advantage in the circle considering the gate is right in the middle i'm going to need my suppli please go for it again let's go can i get a drone i like a high external stone wall i'm going high external wooden gate just give me ammo all right uh the timer is being reset guys so it is back if it goes to 60 there will be punishment everything was just calm in the circle and everyone is happy they survived the second challenge but something terrible would happen very soon yeah d is it is it air drop time again are we are we going for round two good i'm kind of feeling it oh do knew i knew he was trying to play something bro that's messed up b george had placed his ston wall item almost completely blocking off the punishment button now over half the visibility was completely blocked off on the right side and there was only a tiny section of the button you could reach b george just made everything 10 times harder in the circle b george just did something horrible to the circle i don't know if you guys see this yeah no i'm not going to risk stepping around that thing i you can reach it i mean you can reach the button for sure but uh because of that wall and what b george did tensions were becoming very high in the circle now everyone realizes there might be a punishment coming soon because it's a lot harder to press the button now but to lighten the mood doad throw down his second air drop and hopes that it'll land in the circle this time be what you haven't said anything since you placed this wall you want to like speak and explain to the group why you would have done that yeah you know i think you know it just needs some renovations and as doc's air drop was coming down the players were being distracted by it again and the button was left all alone pretty mid and by mid i mean middle of the circle the wind is good so it should drop straight oh no that actually might be a bit out doc it's not looking good trying to close but at the same time it looked kind of far out it's not going to land in the circle you're 0 and to yeah that's way out bro this is actually so dumb inside that box over there oh yeah i got a worm too yeah oh nice nice nice the timer has hit and there will be a punishment bro you guys let the timer go past 60 so i'm going to turn this off nah bro he had a goofy smile on his face he knew it was happening while we were talking damn after 1 hour and 30 minutes of being in the circle the timer hit 60 seconds for the first time it was quiet as everyone didn't know what was going to happen it definitely brought down the mood for the circle as there was only one person to blame for this it was b george all right uh your first punishment is on the way what do you mean by that probably water r going choke is this is not great meteors will now spawn at random on the server and this is going through the entire challenge every few minutes a meteor will come down it's completely random it could do damage it could kill you as well it could damage your buildings but this button doesn't stop there because there's a new punishment coming if they don't press it again uh watch out cuz bro you've dealt with meteors in the first circle video uh so and some of those got really close but timer's back on and next punishment will be different so uh meteors are now active boys oh wait i got to take a bathroom break all right well he i'm going to go too two players needed to go afk which means there's only two players to press press the button since ot liam and b george refused to help and this is where the circle downfall would begin oh there's another meteor oh oh oh that's coming right after us that's actually so it's afk is hitting them oh wao that's really close oh my god that's oh my god all right well those are meteors for you no and the timer again oh come on the group is falling apart uh so there's going to be a land mine so watch out land mine in the circle the circle was now falling apart and a new punishment in the form of a landmine was placed in the circle meaning it could kill and eliminate someone don't tell them don't tell them all right i just got back so i know what's happening now if you guys do work together you can remove this you see this punishment is avoidable if the players work together in rust if someone steps on a landmine but doesn't move you can have another player help diffuse it it requires trust but ot liam is the only person that chose a gun as when of his items and he can shoot the land mine forcing it to blow up and obviously no one is going to trust liam i mean liam you are the only one who could just like shoot it out right now oh there it is can i just saw it twice you can also stand on and have somebody pick it up so liam will you do the good thing cuz you are the only one with the weapon but bez you do have a c4 as well get rid of it but he has many bullets i have one c4 it just takes a couple shots to actually set it off after 5 minutes with this landmine in the circle ot liam had not moved from his position watching that landmine like a hawk he knows it's his one chance to eliminate someone and everyone in the circle realizes he has this power i'm wondering if anyone for will forget but liam is keeping that landmine in sight i feel like he is waiting for someone to get near that i'll be damn if i go out to a land mine about you but i'm on button duty i'm here to i'm here to benefit the circle has anyone done you wrong yet i guess my c4 he tried it i forgot about it wait a second on how much hp did liam get you to bez uh 6 hp no way liam almost killed bez bez how did you forget about that uh i don't know i was i was talking about bez you clutch all right uh with that being said we're going to start our third elimination challenge here we go for the third elimination challenge you guys will be teleported on a twig frame cubicle above the circle at any point if you fall off this cubicle you're eliminated from this challenge but the catch is you all will be given flamethrowers you can use these flamethrowers to break the twig below you and knock someone down below but balance is a huge factor because if you lose your balance in the process you could accidentally eliminate yourself it's up to you to play offensively and try to eliminate someone or play defensively and wait for something to drop before you the person who falls off first is eliminated oh r please literally s that's crazy also for some context for you guys pvp is disabled so the players can't kill each other with the flamethrowers but they can still use their items to their advantage all right 3 2 1 oh no way ot liam has been eliminated oh bab no no way everyone uh gather up ot li he stopped coming gathering up oh liam you may step out of the circle get out of here oh my god gg liam let's go get your interview man oh was actually kind of fun i had i had a plan set up i thought i was on the edge of the corner i was going to burn all of them off and kind of section them i thought it was on the corner and uh i fell right down straight down and that was that out of everyone in the circle who do you think is going to win this challenge though honestly i said i no teams and honestly i didn't i didn't have any loyalty to the be george guy at first but he threw that flashbang so i can i can appreciate that i gave him all my st actually so he has my gun oh really and the bullets too yeah yeah he has everything i'm going to have all the eliminated players at the end come back and you guys are actually going to vote for the winners so the final two people in there way they will plead their case to the jury pretty much on why they should win and you'll cast your vote and whoever has the most votes will win yeah yeah just call me or dm me or whatever i'll probably be all right it is that time again where you guys all get one item to select for the circle everyone line up i'm going to contribute to the circle i'm going to get a recycler doing the recycl look at how happy they are is that good oh yeah that's perfect now having a recycler helps the players a lot because they can recycle their items which breaks down to resources and they can use those resources to craft even more items can i get a computer station i will take another high stone wall high stone oh god yo guys wait a minute wait a minute guys all right there you go uh have to open these pringles for the depression i'm about to feel all right free tick can i have a wood that can't be allowed that can't be allowed bro b george had just screwed everyone in the circle it's now impossible to press this button which means every 60 seconds there will will be a new punishment and all these players would probably die within 10 minutes ending this video we can't even go back there i can't be alow sure you can you know just take the risk on the you know little little red rug of dreams it's guaranteed we die oh my god it's not you just got to be careful you know just don't die don't i love how be geor is probably going to die to his own fault because of the elimination george you know what even if i go out you don't know what you have done you don't know what you have done it's all right i'll take it all right who's next free tick what would you like can i have high external wood wall but there was still one chance left to fix this because baz is the last person to choose his item can i ask for like uh 10 hold on wait wait bez let me let me just step in here for a second okay do you see those two walls right now bez you're the only person that can actually save this so when i activate that timer again it's pretty much going to be a disaster for this circle but you have one c4 right now if you choose another c4 you can remove both of those walls and save everyone right now b you're our only hope you can only remove one cuz it's two c4 baz had an important decision to make here the players stared at him as his decision would decide the fate of the entire circle he already has a c4 that he stole earlier but if he chooses another one as his item he'll have enough to break down one wall and save the entire circle i don't think you want punishment after punishment cuz like people will die in here bez also before you answer those people could be you yeah br this is unfair you know what just give me a c4 i'll blow it up bez does it guys what a beast got to respect it got to respect it your best that's cute here's your c4 that you chose this is backend challenge i'm resetting the timer the timer is currently active right now all right and the button is now visible baz just saved the circle i don't think you guys realize how much appreciation you should be showing i realiz baz had saved the circle and now all things are back to normal but b george was still going to cause trouble in the circle after his plan was ruined just holding who's holding the recycler quite a shame if you can't use it oh b george is just destroying the circle right now he is pissed that he just lost his b george was camping the recycler because in russ only one person can use it at a time and he wasn't leaving the recycler so others couldn't use it you know what george have fun looking at the recycler for now i will have have fun taking that l because you're being led by a guy that only loses oh my god i don't know this the first time he's in a circle he doesn't know what's he doesn't know what's going on right now that is true like guys bra has the most experience here he knows the circle out yeah i think the next punishment i'll announce it do you guys want me to announce it yeah yeah uh the recycler will be removed from the circle if you guys let this button go over 60 seconds but because half the visibility of the button was still blocked off the players will continue to struggle on keeping up with the timer nobody needs this i'm allowed to like say woo next there is a punishment and the recycler has been lost damn all right the recycler is gone you're so focused on me being in the recycler you guys are staying on top of that button now yeah we we literally do for like 15 to 20 minutes and then we just forget about it cuz there's some people who refuse to do button duty that's what i've noticed with just 5 minutes before the next elimination challenge bra had placed down his computer station and drone he's been saving up for it's also an item he could potentially use to his advantage and cause distractions for future challenges br what is the plan with this like how does this drone benefit you or is it just for entertainment uh a little bit of entertainment and also i can use it to monitor the uh the button hey we got drones we got tubes okay it's looking a little lively and we're dancing the circle now hey we're vibing in the circle it's looking a little lively in the circle now things were looking a little hopeful for the circle as people were just dancing playing instruments and vibing out but the next elimination challenge was about to begin and one person from this group would be leaving all right you guys ready to get into the next elimination challenge yes sir maybe for the fourth elimination challenge there are six npcs outside the circle in a bulling pin formation you all will be given a grenade and one at a time will throw your gren at the npc's knocking down as many as you can the player with the least amount of pins knocked down is eliminated from this challenge oh i knew it why we line up and see who wants to go first all right first up is bral again wanting to go first you may throw it when you're ready well that's a good one oh strike a strike on the first grenade goby what i'm talking about that looks good come on how do you guys do it it was baz's turn to go next but bral had brought out his drone and was using it as a distraction now remember baz stole a c4 earlier from bral so bra was doing this as an act of revenge can you stop br hey it's his item man i'm going to use my items oh that's some damage to it oh no that'll take out both the drone and that oh wow b wow baz did it wow that's a rip dude all right bez you can throw when you're ready well let's see if you get karma bro is that going to be circle karma oh oh oh no does that mean i'm out not yet not yet that means everyone on the couch though is safe it's down to be george will that one pin cause you to be eliminated bez b george this is down to you if you miss this we go into overtime but if you hit this then baz will be eliminated b george realized he had the fate of another player in his hands once again he turned around to look at bez one final time before throwing his grenade oh that eliminated oh no bz i'm so sorry my friend rp everyone gather around gather around you were a soldier of this circle okay you saved this circle bez you saved everyone here but it's time for you to leave all right bez you me leave the circle okay bez has been eliminated bez let's go get your interview everyone say goodbye to bez bye mine was mine was further away all right bez after that how are you feeling man not so good all right i everyone in that circle though bez who do you think will win it's got to be free tech oh free tech why is that cuz we we're teammates when it's the final two everyone who is eliminated is going to come back and vote on the winner so uh will you be around in a in a few hours for that yeah all right sounds good go ahead and log off here i so conf oh man guys i how you feeling after that one i know you asked us how we feel normally but how are you feeling i did not want to see that guys that kid did so much for the circle man for this round of items i'm allowing anyone to remove an item from the circle instead of selecting a new one they would want to remove anything from the circle oh actually i would like to remove the gate can i get another computer station i would like 5.56 ammo you know we just lost a really good friend in the circle and i would like to commemorate him with a gravestone a it's for you b congrats you guys have made it to the final four woo let's go baby wow all right uh i'm resetting the timer now but when one person is eliminated the button will be no more and uh you know just because i'm feeling a uh little devious right now i'm actually going to do something i want you guys to pay attention real quick cuz i'm about to play something okay you can do whatever you want with it okay in the end it is your choice if you want to interact with this now i'm about to play a huge mind trick on these contestants throughout this entire challenge i've been training these players to press a button and psychologically engraving it into their heads for the past 4 hours but i'm about to place a sign that says don't press the button what will these players think when they see a sign that says this will they actually listen and not press it like it says to do or will they think it's possibly a reward and use it to their advantage no one knows what this button does yet until someone presses it oh i know exactly what this is don't press the button so that's just going to tease you right there psychologically yeah there's the mental warfare press it you won't insta press um you know it's it's got some nice decoration here a good aesthetic what the i got it b george was just eliminated oh my god b george pressed the button and is eliminated dude w crap well ain't no way well that worked um all right b george you were eliminated you died in the circle so uh it's time to grab your interview this was just a test to the players to see if anyone was going to be greedy and b george failed the test you know what i was honestly hoping that it'd be like a reversal kind of thing where like presses it gets an item i was l key hoping for that what it say got to take risk sometimes when it gets to the final two i'm bringing back everyone who was eliminated and together as a jury you guys will vote you will be voting for the winner so will you be around for that indeed wow wow guys holy sh that was the goofiest thing i ever watched you just walked like i got it for that price what what were you thinking when i place that now that it's gone like was there any thought in your head like oh i want to press it i knew exactly what that was going to be no chance keep forgetting like you guys you guys have made a final three so you guys deserve a fireworks show every final three get a firework show so let's let's get some chairs down no more button either say goodbye to the button it's a tradition in the circle series that the final three contestants get a firework show because it marks that this challenge is almost done we're just one elimination challenge away from the final 2 who will plead their case in front of of all eliminated players of why they deserve to win the $400 prize and the contestants still have no idea that will be happening but for now the final three get to taken the moment after defeating all the contestants before them there it is oh my let's go so final three guys you're almost to the end you know fancy i've seen this firework show too many times it's getting a bit it's getting a bit uh depressing yeah this is nice this is nice this is let me enjoy let me enjoy it well if you guys are happy with this are you guys happy with going into the next elimination challenge yeah let's let's get it over with i guess i don't think i have a choice now although the final three players respected each other in the back of their heads they knew one of them had to go home and the circle was going to decide this i i know i think i know i know i know it it's the wheel it's it's the wheel isn't it you got to be kidding me f guys you know what you know what needs to happen all right no i refuse i refuse the shape of this challenge is a circle and it's the same shape of a spinning wheel it's a tradition ever since the first circle video years ago to have a spinning wheel with everyone's name on it to decide who is eliminated now this is the only challenge that is completely luck and no skill but it's symbolic because it's the circle's way of saying you are not worthy after all the things these players done throughout the hours of being in the circle the good the the bad the circle sees it all and the circle will decide who is most unworthy of going on to the final two listen i know this is tough we have to get in our boat we have to get in the boat the wheel decides your fate it will always decide who is worthy that is just how it is it is a tradition of the circle series the wheel is ultimately telling us who does not belong here all right dude this is honestly the most painful way to go out like yeah it's she not even skill good luck guys good luck best of luck to you guys i think it's time all right there's no going back whoever this wheel lands on will be eliminated from this challenge gentlemen good luck no dude i don't want to look i don't want to look bro no no br that's the first time i lost to rng it is uh the circle has spoke again it is just not your time it's always a circle man oh damn circle man i'm so sorry guys go ahead and uh i i wanted this one for you i really did go ahead and say goodbye pr see you later guys luck to both of you thank you that's so bad br has been eliminated that hurts man bra let's go get your interview man i was feeling pretty good about this circle i was just i was just cruising along i was just doing what i knew best and uh i guess i got to say you know i i perfected every challenge up to this point well for the first time ever out of three circle videos i'm now asking you out of everyone in that circle who do you think will win this challenge i i want to root for free tech when it gets to the final 2 which you are looking at the final two right now everyone who is eliminated will come back as a jury and together you guys will decide and vote on who you want to win yeah it should be around gentlemen how we feeling hello how we have very mixed terrible but if you look at me i'm smiling huge yeah like i feel so bad for bra like he this was his this was his time it must have been for a reason the circle clearly has has spoken today the circle controls everything here is very spiritual in here but uh with that being said we get one more item of your choosing i'm going to need a two stone bro yeah i'm going to need a tombstone actually i i always i always let the final two choose two items so choose two items please i'm going to need a tombstone and another drone for bra let me get another tombstone it got to be for kezza oh for kezza earlier all right i'm putting the tombstone next to his computer station oh this is sad bro this is for kezza and for it got to be b george you put a gra for b george yes that's true he did sacrifice uh where's the baz grave where's the where's that one someone someone picked it up what let me go let me go look over here who who could have done that it was br brolo took the grave of bez no wa that is why he got eliminated from the spinning wheel cuz he picked up the grave and stole it and disrespected the circle nose bro oh my god that's crazy that is that's actually insane damn it br if you hadn't done that you wouldn't have been eliminated at first we didn't know why the circle had chosen bral to be eliminated but once we found out bral stole the grave of baz it answered all of our questions the circle truly does see all and it will always serve justice it was clear frech and doc were not leaving the circle so i had them destroy the button since it's no longer being used in this challenge and it was time to tell them what the last elimination challenge was going to be what actually is going to happen is every single person who was eliminated from this challenge will be coming back onto the server into and they will be voting for a winner and that's terrible as as a jury they will be deciding who the winner is so you must plead your case on why you deserve to win the circle what did you do this challenge that got you to win did you make good relationships with people did you backstab people everything you did in the circle will come down to this moment be prepared cuz they have questions and they some of them are pissed all right because you a lot a lot of those guys didn't like the way they got eliminated like thought they would go farther so sorry if i put so much more stress on you guys i don't know if this will be more stress but it'll also be night time and everything will be dark and like lights and so it was 30 minutes away from the final elimination challenge the remaining two players had 30 minutes to mentally prepare on how they were going to convince the jury to vote for them to win it's crucial to get this right because players like aer who was eliminated within 5 minutes or kezza who was eliminated second have no idea on what happened throughout the circle so these are free unbiased votes how you guys feeling before they start loading in you guys just a little nervous i'm feeling i'm feeling better nerves are common yeah i'm feeling good it's it's it's going i'm feeling good and as the final two waited patiently in the circle it was time for everyone to start connecting back to the server yo what the hell's going on oh my god hey br how you doing kzo how you doing all right we got everyone i'm going to invite you guys back into the discord everyone follow me please everyone go ahead and take your seats in the order you were eliminated in this challenge gentlemen of the circle i want to thank you guys for coming back to be a part of this ending welcome to the the tribal council this is your circle video so you will be voting individually on the person you want to win so whoever has the most votes wins the prize one by one you all can go up to the podium and ask any question to these players on why they deserve the money all right aer you're up all right this one i'm going to direct at both of you i noticed uh that you guys had a total of four graves and there are six of us sitting over here why were two of us skipped over we didn't have enough graves okay so why' you pick the four that you did and why'd you skip two of us they we had the most moments together the one that i picked i mean it's really no hard feelings obviously we got as many graves as possible at the end we couldn't fit for everyone all right great great answers thank you guys all right kza i have a single question free tech in the second challenge of today's video i secretly messaged you asking for advice on how to hit the npc with the molotov yes you told me to aim approximately 1 to 2 ft above the npc's head when but in reality i should have been aiming more in the region of 3 to 4 ft above the npc's head my question to you is simple and will define whether i vote for you fre tech if you truly love me why do you hurt me i didn't try to hurt you man i i think the only reason why i threw it and it hit the and it hit the person is because i think i was running when i threw it so i got a little bit more distance no further questions youra all right ot liam go ahead all right cool man i don't know about the teams what were the teams like uh during this event for each of you i was planning on being friendly with everybody i was on a team with with bra and keza okay what the other one free tech i was just on team with b i just want to keep him alive for as long as i possibly could i see i see all right thanks man that's all i wanted to know appreciate it all right bez you want to go up next yeah okay so whose grave is that who died actually um after you died baz was when the first grave was acquired and placed down in the circle that was that was the item that i asked for cuz i was sad to see you go u i got another tombstone for br because i was even more sad at the rng i think that's it all right b george the stage is yours when it came to pressing the big red button that you weren't supposed to what made you hesitate on pressing it personally it's the the big letters that said do not press this button uh what was the question again all right not paying attention all right oh no okay i got it i got it okay i didn't press the button because why would i try to risk everything for just a possible win that isn't crazy all right i'm done and then finally we have our last contestant br okay for uh for doc i know we've both been you know in an alliance since the beginning of this challenge and uh i i got to ask you cuz you know like at the end of the day there has to be one winner were you ever going to plot against me like were you ever planning to do any kind of betrayal or any kind of way to you know be the winner uh obviously i'm going to answer no and i'm going to try to convince you obviously anybody would say no but um i mean the way that that we reacted obviously to the the circle the way you're eliminated it's it's so sad we had such mixed emotions like we obviously happy that we were still in but um i was super sad that you had to leave like that br is that all i think so all right so what will happen now is you all will be writing on your notes on who you will be voting for to win and what the time we will go out to the water and submit your vote to the box we'll go in order so aer you're up i wish i would have lasted a little longer had some my great ideas great plans no matter what happens i'm going to get out of there at some point unfortun i was in the center i thought i was on the corner and uh i fell right down straight it's got to be pr us for teammates going to say got to take risk sometimes i was just doing what i knew best and uh i guess it comes down to this all right everyone i appreciate you guys being a part of the

uN9D9m1wRgM,3000 Players Simulate Earth Civilization in Rust,7303083,204062,15060,0 days 01:58:46,"in the biggest social experiment ever done in rust we gathered 3,000 players and put them on a replica map of the earth to simulate civilization there are no rules or guidelines for these players they can colonize countries conquer territories or if it comes down to it start world wars in this video you'll see politics between countries at daily united nation meetings wars breaking out between countries and continents and many different types of governments forming as everyone has the same goal in mind ruling the server so with that being said said this is the rust map and all these question marks will be characters that will be revealed throughout this video that play a huge role in the storyline of this video there are 3,000 players throughout this 4-day event with 300 of those players being content creators nevertheless i present to you 3,000 players simulate earth civilization in rust in the first hour of the event players spawn around the world across all continents we have north america south america australia europe asia africa and for those who got unlucky and had to start in the freezing snow antarctica why is it so damn cold and soon all players would start to migrate to where they'd want to permanently settle for this event but our first character being introduced is in north america specifically the united states and his name is president brawo men you see this land in front of us this is where we will build our capital now bral and his men were the first group to secure the united states land therefore self-proclaim braal as president a strict but determined leader to make america a strong unified nation in this event a rich and non-divided society where cities and villages could exist together we will do everything we can to protect this land as it is ours as president brolo and his men chopped down every tree and killed every animal in sight they'd soon clear out the area of where they built the capital of the united states of america now building in america comes with great responsibility because nearby the area 51 location is the mlrs monument a monument in russ where you can missile strike anywhere on the map in the safety of your own home this pos is a great threat to every other nation so president bra holds a lot of power with this weapon in his country not too far away from the usa however is their neighboring country mexico mexico was just getting their start to building their country but president br and his men saw this at the start of the event america was already attacking the people of mexico bra feared that mexico would also want control of the mlrs monument and so the usa invaded mexico's land since this was so early in the event and people didn't even have guns yet bra wasn't worried about other countries interfering with this attack but this invasion would be the start of the america versus mexico war and i spoke with president bra and his men and they told me they were going to secure the country protect our citizens and you know if anybody with us we'll with them the only people we don't like right now is uh the people down in mexico but like bra predicted the leader of mexico carnage doesn't tr the usa having control of the mlrs weapon he believes that mexico should have control of it since they're more trustworthy we've been fighting the us this whole this whole time right we've been trying to take control of abandoned military base due to numbers we have lost it they went deep they got like three rows of comps earlier it's nothing we can't get back it's all good now this would be a common occurrence for wars to start around the server people wanting control of lands it's a huge advantage to settle your land early before others colonize it so throughout the world as all the other countries were doing the same thing building up their land we'd see many different kinds of leadership by country leaders for example emperor of rome harvest who had a presentation slideshow for his roman soldiers with a detailed ranking system within the roman empire now harvest informed me that rome stood for uniform and peace this is the roman empire we're in rome gather all of rome together make this whole area a nice uniform peaceful empire and peaceful area and his goal would be to keep peace within europe since all these other countries are building extremely close to each other but the only thing that wasn't peaceful was the team in the middle east which also happened to be where the best clan in russ was living ot ot over there they're causing issues they're causing trouble they have so many people in their group they're insane right now dude this was team ot i've collabed with ot in many of my videos and they're known for being a clan with the best pvpers in rust they've built in the middle east because there's four oil drills scattered in this area which would make them filthy rich if they controled these also the fact that ot stands for oil team so it fits the name that they build here i spoke with with the leader of ot tanza fany hey tanza now ot was a big organization so they had two leaders ot tanza was more of the political leader where he'd run base operations and negotiate with other countries while the other leader ot dling was their war general this guy is dangerous he doesn't care he wants violence dling is leading the rome team and raid team they have been raiding teams they have been killing and making people very angry so it was a balanced leadership with one guy doing the talking and the other does the fighting and already ot dling was traveling around the world causing trouble oh my god oh my god that's a war crime bro make something is a warme want to die war never changes fancy war never changes look into my eyes fancy think this is my first war right off the bat i could tell ot dling was a businessman he was strictly here to rule the server and already express interest in conquering antarctica i'm going to check out antarctica man antarctica get probably loaded they got hella down there ot dling believed the people of antarctica would be rich in resources because this land had a lot of resource nodes you see in russ resource nodes spawn around more in the snow and since this entire continent was covered in snow ot dling had good reason to believe these people would be rich ot wanted blood and the night invasion of antarctica was about to commence for them yeah he's de he's dead said ot landed their boats on the shores of antarctica and began their night invasion slaughtering the antarcticans there was something on this mysterious continent that ot was looking for something they believed the antarcticans were gatekeeping from the server they couldn't find anything for now but their assault ended when ot discovered a large base in the middle of antarctica and that's where they struck gold now since the map is the world i know what you're thinking did someone build in north korea and the answer is yes of course someone did in fact north korea was being ran by a bunch of youtubers and honestly it's exactly what you would expect welcome to north korea get we execute our civilians for fun my introduction to north korea was the supreme leaders killing their people like it was nothing and yelling at them to go farm killing this guy oh my god oh my god everyone in bas get out there i have the arazi enemy to all all will fall before us i don't care who you are that is not k this man brought tech trash he's a hero of north korea north korea were treating their citizens very poorly so it'll be interesting to see how their society advances but one group who hates the north koreans is yum leader of australia there's been a few pesky north koreans around we've kept them out pretty easily the reason australia and north korea are fighting is because of this landmark the mariana trench a deep trench far down in the ocean filled with loot it's beautiful down here it's peaceful perfect for exploration but the marot trench is in japan territory so i went to go speak to the leader of japan plumbus oh i like your fits dude i like the japanese armor like style you guys are going that's so cool now japan was heavily secured with high walls around their entire island blubus the leader of japan did this to keep the violent north koreans out of his land since they're so close to each other but these countries realized they needed to form as one in order to protect the mariana trench so a peace deal was eventually made between these two countries we are in excellent terms now we just if you actually i'll show you come with me i i erected the bridge of peace between north korea and japan we have we have made trade deals i told them that they can use the northern japan island for resources in order to signify their bonding north korea and japan formed the bridge of peace so all citizens of both countries knew there was unity to write the wrongs of our past i heard you guys are on peaceful terms you know with japan and north korea is is that true it is indeed we are all north koreans and so it was confirmed with the leaders of north korea and japan that there were peace in these territories both parties agreed to share the marana trench as it would be more beneficial for long-term growth it was the best option for both these territories since they're located so close to each other and together north korea and japan would thrive off one another north korea wasn't the only dangerous environment to live in because up in greenland ice glaciers prevented people from building large bases but the people of greenland resorted to a bridge system in order to cross glaciers but since this map is so huge and thousands of players would be joining throughout this 4-day event it would be hard to acquire news throughout the server to know what's going on how would someone in north america know if there's a war happening all the way in australia well that's what the news team is for welcome to confusion news this is your one-stop destination for breaking news from around the map confusion has dedicated his responsibilities to provide valuable news to the server the team goes around the server collecting reports and confusion edits these news episodes and post them in the global warfare discord where over 6,000 people can be found the news team has been on top not just with pvp but with also finding groundbreaking news you guys are under the protection of ot correct well yes we are as you just heard the news team is also under the protection of ot we don't know why yet but some speculate this might be to push out ot prop ganda to recruit more pvpers for their clan but something was off with the news team when i asked them everyone's relying on you no no fake news all right of course never never never okay right never we never do that no no never never okay all right sounds good guys i'll see you have a good time yeah you don't have to worry over back in europe the europeans would quickly discover that these living conditions were extremely difficult and it would start to cause arguments between the nations well they shot at the first arrow at us when we all getting our base down the issue is england doesn't have the resources that we need so we do have to go out of this area as mentioned earlier europe is very condensed and the people of the united kingdom realized they didn't have resources they needed which causes them to go to other territories to farm and now everyone's getting mad the only hope for a war to not break out between europe is in the hands of emperor of rome harvest remember he vowed earlier to keep peace in europe uniform peaceful empire and peaceful area and since he has the largest army out of all the nations the roman empire it's his duty to keep everyone happy me and wium go to farmer conrad he's all stressed out he's saying that the uk are killing him over in denmark were peaceful farmers providing food and resources to keep the european nations alive but the uk killed one of their farmers and harvest didn't stand for this bullying luckily award didn't break out but tension were becoming very strong in europe yo conrad are you home conrad it's fancy oh my god hello fancy how are you doing man man we're just trying to live at peaceful life here and just farm you know the way of farming but there's a lot of guys roaming around and killing all the farmers man conrad and the farmers stood for peace and all they wanted to do was help europe get through this great depression of low resources and be able to feed the people in europe you see this this big water area right here we're going to we're going to fill this up with farms and you see this this flat area over here we're going to have a nice roleplay village we're going to have a nice peaceful area where where people can just relax and have fun but there was one group who saw the farmers intentions and they did not like this and they were not from europe either but they were the neighboring country russia meanwhile i think it's time to introduce you to a new continent it's a beautiful piece of land this is africa just like in real life this continent is known for being rich and resources here the players will find the giant excavator pit in four mining cory scattered around the continent and there was one man who they called the king of africa and his name is diamond kid diamond kid diamond kid leader of africa how are you doing good friends welcome to africa fancy we're thriving here in africa lots of resources lots of food we have water diamond kid informed me that there were two parts of africa south africa and normal africa south africa was very hostile wants to colonize madagascar a group of individuals who changed their names to different characters from the movie madagascar and next thing you know they say yeah you're friends with madagascar and they they shoot me in the head oh battle for madagascar is that true that's true this is true so you are supporting madagascar but diamond kid and the people of africa vowed to protect the island of madagascar and stop south africa from taking more lands and with such weird timing a desperate message was sent out into the global chat from madagascar oh my god ot is on ot is oh my god ot is on their island oh my god ot is on madagascar right now guys oh everyone gear up everyone gear up and go to madagascar right now ot is attacking madagascar go go go i'm i'm going to go over there go go go go go literally as i was speaking to the king of africa ot began attacking madagascar we already know ot is the biggest threat so far on the server and as soon as i tuned in the people of madagascar were being ravaged ot didn't lan the war general arrived on their tugboat and sieged the entire island similar to how they did in antarctica the madagascar island has very minimal resources and the primitive islanders couldn't fight off ot's heavy weaponry their people were being killed off ot was door camping their buildings but fortunately ot realized there was nothing here worth their time and soon would pack up their boat to leave dling what what is your men doing right now you're attacking the peaceful country in madagascar dling no no okay wait wait wait sorry fancy we got to talk we got to talk yeah we do need to talk here well thing about a fancy if everybody was just allied and everyone was just buddy buddied up and just free farming them the islands that'd be no fun that has to be some that has to be some beef that has to be some violence i mean ot dling makes a point this is civilization people will continue to fight on this server and this is just the beginning of it we're still in stage one where every country is getting established but soon this server will start to see more wars as tensions around the world grow but as for ot the world domination continued as they sailed country to country on their tugboat looking for their next victory first it was antarctica and now it was madagascar who would be the next victim to fall under ot with that being said it's time to visit a new continent so i welcome you to south america the biggest country by far building in south america was a brazilian community and they already had a massive base built hello hello is everyone home man my friend how's it going fancy man i don't understand anything you talking can you talk so l please now there was a language barrier here we had to figure out because these players were actually from brazil so english wasn't their first language but luckily they did have a few translators with them fine we all we we own south america man oh brazil eliminating brazil seemed to be thriving in south america but brazil had a secret that no one knew about and that secret was how deadly these players were you'll understand later in the video but as night time settled on the second night of the server there was a moment of peace and silence as all the countries could rest after a stressful day of building up their countries but that peace wouldn't last long he had to run fast it was his only chance of escaping a soldier from north korea escaped the dictatorship of the supreme leaders and fled to the middle east where he met with ot to report the war crimes that are being committed in north korea this soldier snitched out the entire country of north korea explaining they were killing their civilians and treating them poorly and ot ht enough so hot dling and his men arrived on the beaches of japan to went around the walls to start their attack it's a good thing blumb emperor of japan placed these walls around his country because knowing ot they probably would have attacked him as well ot made it pass japan and started shooting up the entire country of north korea to prove a point to the supreme leaders to not execute their civilians the north koreans started freaking out as they knew they were outgunned in this surprise attack what's happening what's happening my bu what's really interesting however was how strategic this attack was because in rush the sun comes up on the east side of the server which happens to be where north korea is ot perfectly timed their arrival before the sunrise and cleared out the entire country right before the sun came up it was brutal watching ot slaughter through all these north koreans but after about 10 minutes of attacking it looked like ot was about to leave as they profited many weapons and armor from this attack but the supreme leader porgi would make a huge mistake that would backfire immediately t this is your final warning if you do not leave now i will fart all over your keyboards why would poor g say that that was the ultimate disrespect to ot so they turned right around and went back for round two but this time they didn't show remorse ot immediately laded up north korea's base and completely took control of their roof access and now the north koreans were panicking even more yo who's in the main base who's in the main base if porgi would have just been quiet none of this would be happening but it got worse cuz one of the north koreans opened the roof access door and now ot had entry to the entire base ot had control of all of north korea's loot inside their base all because porgi was talking smack through the megaphone antarctica madagascar and now north korea ot was proving a point that the middle east nations were a strong uniform country not to mess with with all this violence happening around the world with countries attacking arguing and going to war it raised the question who should be the defenders of peace there needed to be an organization to act as a police force to keep countries in check and that was the duty of the united nations group also known as the un the un's goal was to keep peace between countries and resolve conflicts happening the un was built in cuba and was already constructing a massive wall around the perimeter i met with muala who was the leader of the un and soon i'd meet with a massive team behind this movement oh my god where did everyone just come from so we're trying to be the peacekeepers of the server and we are going to be hosting daily meetings with all the world leaders now the un plans to create an assembly hall for all leaders to gather in one building to resolve conflicts through politics and discussion and once a day all leaders of every country would join in this building to discuss politics in the server but speaking of politics we'd see the very first alliance made between two large nations ot and the united states ot tanza the political leader of ot met met with president br in the middle of a desert and together these two countries had an interest in combining their powers and uh i think america can be a very crucial alliance with you guys and i wanted to formally you know ask if you guys would like to alliance and i can make it worth your while president br was persistent on alliancing with ot as they've been dominating the server and could be a huge ally in fighting against mexico america also has access to the mlrs launcher which could assist ot in future raids where bra could missile strike an entire country both par could benefit from each other only if negotiations go well uh okay yeah we can defin we definitely always uh always need something uh i would like to ask also like what do you guys want their return let's say we you know had you do a hit on someone you raid them or whatever honestly all we want is the out of there r explained the ongoing war in north america against mexico and he quite literally placed a bounty on them yeah it's like a circle base with like a shell and uh that's pretty much it it's pretty bad do you need the name of the guy the main man who's running that base who is it um well i'll tell you he is a streamer his name is carnage he had a lot to say about taking our land from us an agreement was made and now two large and very strong countries were teaming together the united states and ot realized the benefits of teaming together and their first project would be taking out mexico so the us could have full ownership of the mlrs launcher and 30 minutes later it was happening again another nighttime siege the fourth vi them soon about to be mexico all right boys this is operation dark oh fancy fancy fancy did you see the operation on north korea i saw it man i saw the whole thing bro br br's team has been uh has been wiped few times by this team close to them taking their monument controlling the military base that burlo wants to obviously control so he ordered a hit he promised us resources and good alliance and uh anything we need if we go ra them this was going to be a quick inter out mission for ot as they arrived on the beaches of florida to travel down to mexico the people of mexico had no idea this attack was about to happen but they soon we about to find out ot arrived to mexico and would start to build their raid base only a few members of mexico were home so this raid would end very quickly ot started raiding through mexico's base and a few soldiers from mexico were fighting back on the hill trying to stop the attack and take back what was theirs but ot had too much control of the situation and quickly shut down any form of resistance mexico's base was raided right to their coreas a very important deal was made on this day of the event the united states was very pleased of the work from ot and taking out their number one competitor in north america president br paid ot off for their hits and now america had full control of the mlrs launcher which he could use to assist ot and raids this was a mutual benefiting relationship between these two countries which would give them a a huge advantage over the world word got around on the server that ot and america were teamed and now every country realized the other key aspect to this event creating allies it's not only important to attack other nations and conquered territory but ot in the usa demonstrated that you also need friends on the server to survive welcome to global news we're here to provide credible and groundbreaking information we dig for information that nobody else can find we are channel 9 global news gl all right now and coming back to the office we have territory updates and base locations with reporter kezo thanks for that big sexy today on the territory news several large countries have taken their places on the globe ot have the middle east in a choke hole demonstrating their incredible and admiral skills early on in the event over in america the usa is defending its territory against invaders mexico and greenland so far they've been led by a fearless brol in defending successfully and just so you're not confused this episode just came out right after ot raid in mexico so now you're updated that mexico is no longer a threat to president br in south america there are several smaller groups and a slow starting united nations in the north who are now gathering some steam in australia so winter spotted living out of a wonky shack what it lacks in defenses it makes up for in love yom has been seen living the life on the west coast and finally north korea and jaan going to war watch this space as we hear trouble is over in the east wait a second that's not entirely true is it earlier in this video i highlighted north korea and japan were actually on great terms they even built the bridge of peace the bridge of peace between north korea and japan uh so north korea and japan do not like each other right now it has been very apparent we have made trade deals i told them that they can use the northern japan island all you have to do is just look in chat and you'll see we are all north koreans but anyways that has been your daily news for today you will see us later tonight maybe if you have any news report it and make sure to add us in chat everyone's relying on you no no fake news all right of course never never never the news team was manipulating the server into believing false information and trying to control tensions between other countries this was a malicious move by confusion and no one knows that he's doing this but it's a mastermind idea that could give him an advantage in this event meanwhile checking back in on rome the roman empire was growing and i was even able to visit their ceremony where i witnessed several members be promoted within the raking system one of these people being youtuber wium who is now the second in command of rome oh guys uh you may know me as willie it's actually may will jim guys what's up harvest believed wilum is the best representative to speak at future un meetings and help promote peace in europe but one thing i was curious about was how mexico is doing we saw them get raided early by the us and then again by ot mexico was taking a brutal beating and so early into the event so i spoke with carnage leader of mexico to see if they were surrendering in this event yo uh carnage are you home yeah what up what up what up i i i i hear enthusiam in your voice and that's good but i saw what happened earlier and i wanted to get your take on it man we just got roam rated pretty that was that was unlucky as hell so everybody started panicking and running back and then and it was a it was a freaking mess yeah the us ones are le and we're not going to give it to them we're not we're going to fight for it this is our country we're going to defend our country to the very last man yeah we're not giving up man we're not giving up mexico does not give up no matter under if the whole world comes against us we will fight until the last man standing you you you are a motivation bro you are awesome you are a great leader man it's going to be a bloody war with america and ot man but you guys got you guys got pride here for sure even after being raided twice even after suffering tons of losses to america and ot mexico was not backing down mexico was lucky to have a courageous leader like carnage keeping motivation within his country carnage let president br have the mlrs launcher for now but ot america didn't just stomp out the fire of mexico they poured gasoline on it because now mexico is pissed now mexico has a reason to keep fighting and they will have their revenge but ot wasn't bothered by this in fact they had complet completely forgot about mexico because just like every other country they've attacked they were moving on to their next target and that's exactly where ot was heading right now antarctica earlier in this video ot attacked antarctica and that's how we were introduced to them but they were going right back to finish the job they started but not just to shoot up the place this time this time to raid the headquarters of antarctica is in the center of the continent and it's the same base ot scouted earlier antarctica knew this attack was coming was antarctica stream sniping possibly did they get their intel from another country also possible i have no idea how they knew this attack was coming but it was too late for ot to pull out now they had to commit the antarctican stormed on the roof trading shots with ot clan knowing that the most dangerous team was now raiding them ot is fresh off raiding mexico and attacking numerous countries so they're all warmed up ot was getting their raid base going but since antarctica somehow knew this attack was coming they showed great resistance right off the bat high walls were being placed every for cover and ot was trying to establish control at the front of the base and because of those walls the antarcticans knew they had to push up to attack ot deaths were everywhere in this battle both sides were dying in this massive battle but once ot started rocketing antarctica lost control ot was able to siege into the base and climb up the top levels preventing anaro from using the shootdown floors but after the long lasting fight ot did the same thing they did to mexico and eventually blew into the core their base and secured all the loot the snow in antarctica was read after that bloody war but ot had successfully raided the antarctica headquarters got some groundbreaking news groundbreaking news watch now watch uh whose base are we standing in right now airpods ot has just completely wiped out antarctica otherwise known as earpods group according to an ot member the reason for this raid is that the leader earpods had stolen one of ot liams base builds a year ago was this trade justified what do you think now there was still one country who had my attention and that was brazil so i went back to south america there's just something so intriguing about this country because they didn't speak english i wanted to learn more about them and understand the culture they're bringing to the server and i'm glad i met with one of their translators because i was about to learn something crazy happening to brazil as you can see brazil took over south america and the whole of brazil as well obviously i don't know man we've been betrayed by by we were really trying to be really friendly in the beginning some people calling themselves the un striking first i don't know how that works you know what sort of un this say that shoots first and ask questions later according to kira here the un was attacking brazil at first i was confused because the un stands for peace and are the protectors of the server they're not supposed to be attacking other countries so i learned from kira that brazil has a president so i went to go speak with their leader to get more info on this the the president is is uh is currently raiding 025 northeast i asked juny the president of brazil about his thoughts on the un yeah yeah sure uh which my base come here hey let's go so i heard you're the president of brazil is that true yeah yeah yeah i i i i would like ra un but i think the meeting is good but i don't know i could tell juny the president of brazil felt conflicted he wasn't sure why the un was attacking brazil but he thought the daily un meetings that will be hosted are cool he wants to like them but it's very hard when his people are being killed by them the un was doing something they weren't supposed to be doing attacking other countries and promoting violence the worst part about it though is the brazilians don't speak fluent english so it'll be difficult for them to expose the un on their corrupt actions but i went to the un to see if their allegations were true oh i i i don't think there's there's i think brazil may feel the tension between us but i think we're pretty pretty friendly with them you know we're just uh trying to trying to find and trying to get built up and trying to make some good stuff but we'd like brazil to come so we can talk it out a bit more we're hoping we can squash as much beef as possible but we were still fight for justice there was just something off with the un on how they responded to my question he basically confirmed that these allegations were true and the un was attacking brazil brazil and the un were on the verge of an allout war from starting but over in europe a new rivalry was about to begin russia heard about the peaceful farmers in europe trying to get them through the great depression and russia was wasn't going to allow their neighboring countries to be more economically stable than them this is the hashtag clan the hashtag clan that represents russia was now raiding the peaceful farmers of denmark and it was completely unnecessary god the farmers are being raided right now no no these poor farmers don't want to fight they just want to provide food and resources for the people of europe but russia was a attacking this base as if it was the bank that had all the cash in it russia felt if europe got through the great depression it would pose a threat to them so not only did they raid the farmers but they continue to run through the european nations and attack all the other citizens as an act of terrorism don't deserve this oh my god that's that's messed up that's messed up conrad oh my god f has cled us they raided us why why did they raid you why i don't know i was telling them that this is the weed farmers and we're just some friendly farmers but they didn't listen they didn't want to talk with me now everything is gone now one person who didn't appreciate this attack was emperor of rome harvest we know his motive is to keep peace between europe so this was a wakeup call for him this was also something harvest intended to bring up at the un meeting in hopes that the un would step forward and resolve this but little does harvest or anyone know the un is also secretly committing act of terrorism to brazil there were too many secrets happening around the world but eventually they would be leaked but it was now time for the very first un meeting of this event where all leaders from every country would meet together in one building for the first time the un created the meeting hall but since it's only day one the roof wasn't finished yet but in future meetings this building would be complete the un staff are in blue gear surrounding the meeting hall for security measures so no one comes in and assassinates a leader the un also placed beds for all leaders so that way no one could bring bring a dangerous weapon into the building that's also the reason why every leader doesn't have armor it's all on peaceful grounds thank you and welcome to the first inaugural global leadership meeting here in the united nations assembly hall together side by side we can meet to address world conflicts and work together for a better and peaceful world here's how the un meetings work moy doa who is the un director would go up to the map and call up a country to speak is there anybody here from north america i think we can all work together by making a peaceful world i don't think war is really worth it so far the first meeting was going well to fast forward some of the boring talk most countries were wanting to keep peace and looking good in front of the un and all leaders but things didn't get heated until a group of protesters were being chased by un guards outside the building and little did everyone know one of these protesters would start an entire war the un sucks the un is corrupt you guys suck you guys suck that was the un moy doa the leader of the un thought it was someone who stuck inside the building screaming she couldn't tell who it was so she killed the first person she thought it was and do you know out of all the people she could have killed it happened to be the vice president of brazil now the un has been attacking brazil all day one and the people of brazil don't know why since they're supposed to be the defenders of peace the only reason why brazil hasn't been fighting back is because they think the un meetings are good i think the meeting is good so even though this was a pure accident and muy doala thought she was killing the mic spammer brazil saw this as another way to disrespect them and there were going to be consequences for this there's more team there's more teams anyone that's located in south america you you guys kill mying chad i'm going you gift it brazil had enough they were tired of being pushed around in silence from the un so they they got geared up that night to send a message to the world that you don't disrespect brazil it was pure silence when running back to the un building as these soldiers knew this would be the start of the brazilian war there are a lot of pressing matters that we should talk about and since i'm here we might as well talk about it right now conrad can you come speak with me can you come down here there's something very sad that just happened we were all some peaceful farmers they didn't want to communicate and they straight up raided our farm in our village # clan raided the weed farmers raiding the the scandinavians stand together getting raided we're getting raided brazil knew there would be consequences after attacking the un but that didn't matter to them the whole world would see them as violent people but but in reality they were just fighting back for their freedom all the un security had to report back and hold the lions to defend their bases so i po my radar to see how many attackers there were holy yep it's south america south america's coming over to shoot everyone up that guy was not kidding in the meeting now brazil didn't bring all their explosives this was just a warning to the un but now brazil's reputation was down the drain because everyone thinks brazil just shot up the un for no reason they were misunderstood but they need to find a way to expose the un well the next morning a new player joined the server but this wasn't just a normal player hence why he's getting his own introduction this would be someone who changes the entire world and his name is coconuty koko traveled the entire world through deserts mountains and roads to find the perfect country to settle in but it wasn't until he came across a small humble town of only a few villagers located in north america now although this town was very poor and small in koko's eyes it was beautiful and he wanted to make this place his home this would be the start of aradia to be honest with you we might have to up our town for appearance level i feel like our town looks very poor got to get more going you know we i mean we i don't know like listen guys i'm supposed to if i'm trying to be the president of the united states of america i can't be associated with a job sign is that a massage parlor that's a massage that's your that's my house what the wait that's my house what the i can't live in a massage parlor guys ne we need like solar panels and like irrigation and hyponic and crops and stuff we got to get a water sorus we got to get uh pigs we got to make this town stand up we got to make it technologically advanced maybe okay um it's a far stretch but maybe we could find someone to massage people and someone off i mean that would at least attract some tourism i got to do more meetings but we got to get this town growing now koko just mentioned something very important koko wants to take presidency of the united states of america if i'm trying to be the president of the united states of america now obviously there's an issue because the fierce president br is already running the united states bra has been attacking mexico and creating alliances with ot br is untouchable compared to coconut koko was a mayor of the small poor town but it would be his goal somehow some way to make it to the top and gain presidency of the united states he was the only person willing to stand up against braal and was already starting arguments in the us me giving you the base was me humbling myself to give you respect president and you spat all over me with your men you guys didn't trust me so this forced coconut be to start a new war but this wasn't a country versus country war this was a civil war i'm a this town right here may appear small and humble but we're looking to make a difference kokab b was quick to realize the tyranny of president br and one thing he doesn't like is bullies some called koco the savior that north america needed because this entire time the united states has been under strict authority enforced by bra so kokoni was the one to start the retaliation against the authority this was the american civil war coconut be officially started the civil war against president br america was under attack and the entire country was fighting in this civil war coconut be's town was quickly growing as he was recruiting more soldiers to his side and soon he'd have an army to go against bral would you like to join the cause and join the movement yes there was nowhere safe for this country every single citizen living here was in war you could either choose to fight for your freedom with coconut be in the town of aadia it's either you're with me or you're against me or standby with president bro and keeping strict security of the united states koko was like robin hood he was stealing guns and armor from the rich country of the united states and supplying aadia residents to fight against the us president bro was not expecting this to happen as he was dealing with big problems like the war against mexico or sustaining his relationship with ot so having to deal with a civil war and losing guns and armor was detrimental to his time but this would just be the start of the american civil war a battle of a small town versus the united states of america what you're witnessing is going to be a birth of a mecca it's all going to happen right before your eyes but before day one ended cokin b had one final meeting with the un what would happen if the us were to top one fall what would happen then what would be your action from the un if you take an action we're going to stay out of it coco perfect okay i was a bit worried that you guys were going to step in to uh absolve this war that's going on uh in america but if you guys were want to step aside and let me handle and take care of business then in uh i guess in 12 hours time there will be a new president that will be me the un was doing exactly the opposite of what they stood for instead of being peacekeepers for the world they were continuing to allow violence between other countries but why why was the un push ing for violence when they're supposed to keep the peace on day one we learned the dominance of ot as they raided and attacked numerous countries while forming a strong alliance with the united states of america we know the us is at war with mexico and the news station for the server is pushing out fake news north korea and japan formed their alliance bar at war with australia and emperor of rome harvest is struggling to restore peace in europe because the russian hashtag clan are attacking the peaceful farmers antarctica was eliminated and completely raided by ot and the brazilian war has started against the united nations and we close off day one with coconut bees plan to take over the united states and become the new president how will these issues be resolved will war start to break out well let's see what happens on day two welcome to day two of global warfare day two would bring a lot more action to the server as all the countries had day one to build up and farm and day two we'd see more territory fighting politics between countries and wars breaking out between nations and continents so let's go see what the players are up to today up it was a fresh new day which meant fresh new stories for the news team and they were traveling to north korea for the next big scoop but remember north korea is not a fan of the news team because they were blasted in malicious lies saying japan and north korea were at war uh so north korea and japan do not like each other right now it has been very apparent get that well what's been going on in happy old north korea i want to call north koreans they're not slaving away hard enough hon well that's about all we needed to ask all right play outro costa outro outro please all right everybody the fake news media the fake news media north korea wasn't going to forget what the news team had said about them and they weren't going to let them leave peacefully go you're the king no i'm the king oh the north koreans had the news team pinned in a country full of people that hated them north korea destroyed the news van barely leaving it functional but somehow the news team was able to escape this would be a story that the news team could use to their advantage but unfortunately had to leave behind two of their reporters to be captured by north koreans moving over to south america the brazilians were ready to prove their dominance the brazilians had built up their community with a strong unified base and a peaceful flla in which they'd invite other countries to hang out and enjoy the beauty of brazil but brazil wasn't all sunshine and rainbow because they were about to raid fy su ma looks like you're busy are you guys about to do something where you guys going r i wish you guys the best of luck okay i hope you guys succeed okay brazil on top brazil on top good luck guys brazil had pride on this team but the only thing that was bothering them was how the un was treating them killing the vice president at the leader meeting and invading brazilian territory brazil felt a little left out because they didn't speak fluent english and they didn't want to be disrespected by this and well a base in north america was about to pay for that we're not a part of america we're trying to kill them please don't do this while watching that raid that's when i realized how deadly the brazilians were if brazil doesn't start getting the respect they deserve any country could be next on their hit list i checked back in on farmer conrad who was brutally raided by the hashtag clan earlier in this event and he seemed to be doing much better we couldn't have done it without the help of harvest and all the other people man we are farming now we are back to farming i almost gave up i almost quit fancy that's why i wanted to talk to you man i wanted give you that motivation bro and i'm glad you stuck there i love you fancy meanwhile in the top of africa for some reason france was established there and i was able to bump in out a conversation with the france leader and president of the united states br how many people you got online right now uh a lot like i think that we're full in team ui right now we're trying to recover cuz we've been we've been having some issues with mexico all day yesterday i do want to work out something you guys and i can help you and you guys help me that' be awesome okay okay now this felt like deja vu all over again i think america can be a very crucial alliance with you guys once again bra was trying to make alliances with big teams to support his war in north america we saw him alliance with ot in the middle east and now he's doing the same thing with france bra was pinned in north america with mexico going to war in aadia causing a civil war and now the president realizes he has to continue to ask for help from other countries i'm glad that we could meet i hope that the us and the french can work together throughout the rest of this event i hope so as well i think we'll be a great ally to each other y yep yep yep but it's seems bro had made another peace deal with the king of africa diamond kid watch jack hamers from the usa doing trade deals we got 17 oil barrels and we put them inside of excavator so president br had also made an alliance with the king of africa a very strategic one as the people of africa would supply president bro resources since their continent is very rich but africa is still at war with south africa south africa they walled off um sua cory and you know we don't even knew s cory so we didn't really care but like we kind of took offense to that so you know the people of south africa have been w falling off cory's and preventing the rest of the people from using its resources but diamond kid is depending on america to supply them with weaponry to fight this african war during negotiations bra promised the people of africa that they would have the support of america in this war usa is our ally what allies do they they protect each other they support each other and that's exactly what we're going to do i went to the united states to speak to br and there i discovered their password system it takes so long to climb up this base i'm not who the fck can iam away it's me bro what are you doing what do you mean wait what's the code word what's the code word what's the code word oh he doesn't know code word oh apple juice apple juice apple juice is that it is that the code word fancy help meit someone's getting their ass beat down there out of here all right mr president i need to talk to you man cuz i've been watching you for the past 12 hours you seem to be very busy you seem to one be having a lot of enemies going after you and then two i see you you're having a lot of meetings i actually accidentally walked in on you twice having two different meetings today this entire side of the world at the moment has become sort of a hot zone for pvp there is a group by the name of uh mexico they've been trying to f with us at any moment they can and they're trying to reclaim their land i'm not even going to lie i wasn't expecting coconut to beat a pull up but i also more more so i wasn't expecting coconut be to be aing rat man he was starting man god damn that guy was a pain in the ass yesterday but we we dealt with it we dealt with it what do you oh wait what do you mean what how did you deal with it well there's a little village in in in uh i14 you can check for yourself and so that's what i did i went over to acadia and that's when i discovered the truth the united states of america had raided the town of aadia all of the buildings were destroyed and looted it was now a ghost town the president had ended the civil war although this was a major victory for president br his main ally ot were unhappy with him as we know bra placed a bounty of mexico starting his relationship with ot but tanza came over to the usa for a meeting so obviously yesterday after we did a mexico hit for you guys after that we wanted to go straight for antarctica we were we were expecting amas strike from but uh apologize listen i know i know what you're going to say i know what you're going to say now their agreement was after ot took out mexico the usa would have access to the mls launcher and could assist ot in future raids remember when ot went to raid antarctica president bra was supposed to mls the base but he didn't ot was expecting a missile strike from the usa during that raid but it never came through all of the antarcticans were on the roof and that raid would have lasted minutes but instead that war lasted a full hour so ot tanzo was not happy with the president breaking his promises i apologize guys that we couldn't help you in that situation and i'm telling you this i would have if i could have i i wanted to help you i did but i couldn't i just couldn't at the time i i know you guys are working with the news team closely and i think they are the ones oh my god not us not us not us not us not us that's not us that's not us during that conversation a soldier from mexico snuck in the base and assassinated both the president and the leader of ot furthermore proving that mexico didn't forget what the usa and ot had done to them on day one it's mexico mexico you want to get sieged again oh my god ot is pissed yo i have a bed but mexico's combine bro oh holy their bases are big enough i need i need to update you tanza i'm not going to lie mexico has been really striking back so i went over to mexico to see how big they've expanded and ot tano was not kidding mexico had expanded by a lot mexico had four bases the size of br's main base and a huge compound surrounding mexico like i said earlier ot in the usa didn't stop out the fire when they raid mexico on day one they poured gasoline on it mexico was back in this event stronger than ever during day two however braal sent one of his soldiers to conquer hawaii he would use these islands to help build a navy away from the mainland and to my surprise when i checked back in on them there are a few new residents living on these islands hello fancy how's it going so yeah what's life been like on hawaii though there been a little bit of struggle with resources but pretty good you can you can blame this guy for that yeah whoever made this map didn't put trees on here although resources were very scarce on hawaii they were building a strong harbor of tugboats and had a navy fleet on standby for the usa you guys got tugboats yeah we have four hey four tug boats oh my gosh you have like a navy over here this is where president br keeps all the usa's boats they even had a hotel for any residents wanting to take a vacation to hawaii come check out my hotel o welcome hotel checking back in on north korea the ongoing war against australia was going very well for the north koreans we took the first w uh we just took a w at oil rig we beat australia and we got a free scrappy from them look at that that's theirs so has the war been ongoing with you in australia yeah it's been pretty consistent but i did hear you guys assaulted the news team you guys know anything about that edited footage you guys hate north korea north korea was still angry at the news team for lying about them in the first episode we saw they rocketed the news van when they were in north korean territory so these two groups were still unhappy with each other but a new group was emerging on day two of the server a very dangerous one this is trappist stand this is a group led by youtubers dirt rider and archam known for making trap bases and they built in afghanistan they have a horse farm for unlimited scrap and they use that scrap to buy helies and cause terror around the world we're the terrorist organization of the server and we don't like anything going on that wasn't approved by us if it is approved by us we'll still blow it up this group is only here to cause violence and with that being said traan personally invited me to watch an attack they were about to launch on rome now emperor harvest of rome is currently constructing the coliseum for all romans to enjoy fights and giving away prizes for his soldiers but trapan was about to launch an attack on this building harvest was just having a meeting with ot tano but soon his entire country would be under attack we have like a ton of sulur just dispers some the different villagers bases and we also have trapan launched a massive heli siege on rome shooting missiles down at the roman coliseum helies flooded the air as the romans tried shooting back to stop this attack some of the trapan pilots were shot out of the air and the roman empire was on red alert all citizens had to report back to the capital and defend this national attack but fortunately for rome trapin had used all of their rockets in the surviving pilots flew back home out of the 14 trapan attackers rome only took down five of them the national attack on rome shook the european nations and that's when europe realized they needed a stronger security but back in hawaii these beautiful islands were about to see its end as we saw the peaceful islanders had very little defense and only a few residents living there but because it's us territory carnage the leader of mexico was about to launch an attack a few of the hawaii residents saw this attack coming and were able to rescue the tug bus from being stolen by mexico but had to leave behind everything on the island and carnage of the mexican soldiers destroyed all of it the hawaiians aren't really a part of the american versus mexican war since they're so far away and isolated from north america so this is very low of carnage to attack a small group of peaceful islanders but since bral keeps america's tugboats here the hawaiians are automatically considered a part of br navy carnage was enraged that he wasn't able to take america's tugbo and that the hawaiians sacrificed their islands in order to save the navy fleet so carnage made sure that hawaii felt the wrath of mexico after all the fighting and the wars between these countries this was mexico's way of saying we are back carnage wanted to send president br a message that day and it was certainly received did you guys just invade hawaii is that what just happened yeah yeah we're taking over the us man we're taking back the land they stole from us we heard we saw a couple videos of the us telling ot to radios or some something like that so yeah we're just getting payback on the us man so there's no peace options at all like it's just completely war like at all zero z0 z0 alliances with the us now although mexico didn't take any boats from the hawaii navy he ransacked all the buildings and left nothing behind when the word got out to president br it was too late and he failed to defend his people of hawaii but with that being said it was time for the day 2 un meeting where all leaders around the world would meet for the second time this was an opportunity for all leaders to discuss their issues and present them in front of the world and obviously a lot had happened so this would be a very crucial meeting world leaders thank you so much for coming so we're going to go around and see if there's any pressing issues that anybody currently has if anybody wants uh to take the stage for a moment oh all right going carnage is it true i saw a video i saw a video that you told ot to raid us is that true his name is carnage so he ordered a hit he promised us resources i cannot confirm or deny that is it true that you raided a bunch of innocent farmers and role players ers along the entirety of the west coast of america did you guys just invade hawaii yeah we're taking over the us man yes i raided a bunch of talkers at least if we raid we raid them ourselves we don't ask for help to raid somebody is there going to be peace between usa and mexico is there anything we can resolve time zero peace all take a seat take a seat how's hawaii how's hawaii oh oh that that's personal now is the time to speak up would anyone else like to go to the center and address an issue against another community yes me i have with the news they're spreading propaganda i even have proof spreading fake news about north korea i don't think the daily news channel can be trusted anymore we came to north korea to visit on business and we were attacked by your villagers you're the king no i'm the king western capitalistic lies come uh come rus huh before i begin my message i'd like to tell you a bit of a story my name is coconut b i immigrated over to alaska with a future in sight i then met president brol who promised me a great future in the american dream work hard he said get paid taxes he said i called president bro to which he did absolutely nothing he doesn't care about us i think the fact that mexico comes into our country makes me believe that this man is is not fit to lead nobody respects president bro and his passive aggressive ways of dealing and leading i would like to step up to the stands and become the president and the leader of the free world let this be a warning sometimes conflict must take place in order for peace to prosper president bro the vice president we need to make america great again so far the second un meeting was going well many of the countries were able to discuss their issues and some were able to resolve conflict but no one realized there was a group group in the building that wasn't supposed to be there and that was the trapist stand leaders trappist stand wanted to make their presence known on day 2 and the whole world was about to find out we're the terrorist organization of the server and we don't like anything going on that wasn't approved by us if it is approved by us we'll still blow it up my name is willie you might also know me as wi let us remember our shared humanity and unite in the pursuit of peace we can rewrite the narratives that bind us let compassion and justice be our legacy we are all capable of greatness in this room come on guys let's lead with love not hate thank you very much how do you know how did you know there submarines coming run run run trapist leaders somehow snuck into the un building with grenades and started blowing up the leaders throughout the world and it looked outside after the missile strike hit and the heles were flying over bombing the un buildings please please oh my god we need counter this way now oh my god i need to call my team i need to call my bring here right now bro on this day of global warfare the entire world learned the danger of trapist many of the world leaders were assassinated during this attack in the un failed to provide security and protect the people the attack on the un was heard around the world that day i'm good i'm good i got it i got it after that un meeting i posted an announcement in the global warfare discord because tomorrow on day three a very important event would happen on the server this is the video that was broadcasted to all the players if you're listening to this message i need your help somewhere random on the map i'll be locked in a building with guards it's your goal to free me from this building and escort me back to your main base i'm going to have a live tracker on me so anyone on the server can see my location moving on the map and will be attempting to do the same thing as you if a group dies and fails to escort me i stand still waiting for the next person or group to come grab me i'm not allowed to transporting helicopters cars horses or trains everything must be on foot now why do all this what's the point well the person or group that successfully escorts me back to their main base will receive a nuclear bomb and this is what it's capable of the person who wins this event will be the most powerful person on the server and has the capability of wiping out anyone on the server instantly this is the only nuke that will be on the server so good luck and so it was official the entire server now knew that a nuke would come into play that can wipe out any base on the map the players realized that tomorrow would be a massive day and every country needs to go for this nuke as it holds a ton of power but the only person who seemed unbothered by this was was coconut b cuz he had something else on his mind remember last night president br raided the town of acadia so koko logged onto his server with nothing and well he knew the only group on the server who hated br just as much as he did carnage carnage nice to meet you oh yo yo what up what up i see you're doing great things with uh mexico i'm very uh yeah you like it yeah i love it vi mexico listen to carnage i understand you guys have a personal affairs with uh with us and the president right now is that correct yeah president i think he's a piece of we're based over in uh i14 right now at aadia we have a small town i'm thinking it' be a real shame if we uh we merge right the capital together be a real shame i'm down to do something with you and your people i guess we can keep a keep a contact for now and keep each other posted on what's going to happen but you guys decide to attack us just know that uh you have the support of support of arcadia negotiations went very well for arcadia and mexico these two groups formed a deal because they both had a common enemy but as this was happening things were looking very bad in europe the russian hashtag clan was raiding the peaceful farmers again i toed right into attack and the farmers were not happy this time all right guys there will have to be a war now we don't let this slide but all of a sudden there was a resistance emperor rome harvest vowed there would be peace in europe and he was not letting the russians get away this time rome and greece stormed over to the farmers base to stop the raid on the farmers because europe could no longer let violence enter their continent and it was working rome and greece had pushed back the hashtag clan to russia and stopped the attack on europe but this wasn't enough for emperor harvest he wanted to make a statement to russia and so harvest gathered the entirety of europe alongside with ot do you remember right before trapist attacked the coliseum harvest was meeting with the leader of of ot emperor harvest had convinced ot in negotiations earlier to help raid the hashtag clan because if russia kept attacking the european nations they'd eventually start attacking the middle east and since there are ton of oil drills in the middle east ot wasn't going to let that happen and so the plan was complete and all parties knew what they had to do and you know who tried to raid the farmers and who tried to take everything from them it was hashtag clan trying to make a peaceful nation with farmers they not only raided us once they raided us twice yes for the farmers okay this is for the farmers we'll we'll probably raid slow like don't think it's going to be a pummel or anything any enemy kits that you get just take it back to your red base instantly don't panic if they're like pushing out and stuff this li 50 of us just be good fors roman gre would stay in the back with the raid base and ot would be doing their dirty work pushing in raiding through the base it was an obliteration now the hashtag clan knew but it felt like being bullied by the bigger fish and experienced the same treatment they been giving to the peaceful farmers when you have the best clan in russ raiding you along with rome and greece two massive countries there was nothing the # clan could do in this raid would quickly be over the hashtag clan was officially removed from the server and peace was restored back in europe over back in america a new war would begin today would be the downfall of president brao in the united states because earlier today two groups who hate brw merged together mexico and aadia you guys decide to attack us just know that you have the support of arcadia mexico wants their revenge and coconut b wants presidency this was a two versus one battle take control of that tower roger that we'll take control of that tower we're going we got it we got it there was a giant tower overlooking the united states and br's men were positioned there mexico soldiers couldn't push in because of this tower so carnage ass signed coconut being his forces to take it over team we're going to take that wood tower to our east laders right here because because this tower overlooks the entire battlefield this would be a crucial point to control take that that tower boys go to the tower meanwhile mexico were building up their raid bases and preparing for this attack the us soldiers realized they were outnumbered here with two countries attacking them so president br made a quick call to even the odds go go there's a huge team in our town like a 20 from our town side town are youing serious it's not getting ra it's not getting ra they're just pushing through it they're going to flank mexico right now the french were now in america and they were coming right to the raid to support brolo this was no longer a battle now this is a world war all right no no we got to fall back we have to fall back we need to fight that team we need to fight that 20 man go to mexico they're going to kill them we saw earlier today br make an alliance with the french i think we'll be a great ally to each other defit and he had called them over to help america because br didn't have enough men to win this war coconut be had to cut them off to prevent the french from reaching mexico go go go mexico mexico the 20 guys coming for you what direction what direction they're coming to the raid we're going to hold for you from high 14 we'll handle them on my marker red marker all on the rock but take them out here they are that's them take them the out charge in let's go france wasn't expecting the cut off and their men were dying left and right the admirable leadership by coconut be allowed him and his men to prevent france from reaching mexico to stop the raid on brw so it left france no choice but to fall back and retreat out of america they're far back aadia had pushed back the french soldiers and now could return back to the raid on president br we took them out let's go back to the raid boys mission accomplished returning back to battle leader of mexico carnage was able to take control of the tower but he needed reinforcements badly because he was stuck up there alone te let's go let's go let's go on me america was now taking heavy damage the mexican soldiers were now able to push up and start rocketing the base america had lost a lot of momentum now that they realized that france was leaving their country and not able to help the usa carnage yeah come up here i'm up here i took over the tower i'm coming i'm coming how we doing how's mexico doing good good good we we took out a 20 man look come here i'm going to leave you i got to go back with my team destroy these bags okay destroy all these bags all these we will we will we will cage believe it or not that's when this raid took a quick turn and now aadia mexico would start to lose momentum because america still had one more alliance to call in get out get out get out ot arrived in north america now president br wasn't alone you see ot had just finished raiding the hashtag clan before this raid so they were already geared up weapons ready to go and left russia to immediately go assist president bra no one was expecting them to pull up and worst of all ot landed behind both of these teams so now mexico and aadia were the ones pinched in the middle what's going on possible fight from the south oh my god oh my god there's a 50 man coming from the south it might be ot it might be ot they're here to counter us for ot this would be an easy in-n-out job all they had to do was cross the road and flake mexico and with coconut being and aidia stuck up in the tower there was no one in their way to stop them they had full control of the situation holy holy there they're all there they're all there holy they're going for mexico they're rocking these mother these mother these traders traders and that's when koko realized it this battle was going to be lost ot managed to get behind mexico and stopped their attack and president br was able to secure his base in the night time thinking back it makes sense why ot would arrive in america for this world war ot and america established their alliance by raiding mexico on day one and earlier today we saw a mexican soldier assassinate the leader of ot so oil team was more than happy to crash this party on day two of global warfare br demonstrated that having allies in this event is a huge factor and he owed them a lot for saving his ass today and as the war in north america was concluding over in africa a new one was about to start you see the people of africa were still being tormented by the group in south africa south africa was blocking all the cors and preventing ing their own people of this continent from accessing valuable resources diamond kid the king of africa had no choice but to go to australia for help and they were ready to assist the people of africa and together they signed a treaty to alliance to form as one to raid south africa in south africa from day one has been f with us f with us all and we will not let that stand who's with me this was the battle for africa 60 minutes later after a long fought battle africa and australia failed to raid south africa dead bodies were everywhere as the people of africa and australia felt defeated leader of africa diamond kid made an alliance earlier with the usa so they could help him with this raid but they never did diamond kid then realized that president br left him in the dust and let africa fight a losing war us is our ally what allies do they they protect each other they support each other and that's exactly what we're going to do australia was the only group willing to help diamond kid but since everything was so rushed and america didn't send africa rockets this unorganized raid was doomed from the start south africa would continue to take over the rest of the continent and would continue to control all resources in africa on day two of global warfare we saw a lot more politics between count countes which led to more wars happening everyone is starting to make alliances now as people realize it's crucial to thrive on this server but day three tomorrow would change the entire event as the hostage event will take place in the country that wins it will be receiving a nuclear bomb that can destroy any base in seconds tomorrow would be a very stressful day for everyone welcome to day three of global warfare tensions were very high today as the hostage event would be held and one country would be obtaining a nuke a nuclear bomb that can destroy any base in seconds so with that being said let's go see what the players are up to today once again it was a fresh new day which meant fresh new stories for the news team except they were about to get a story in fact north korea and japan were heading right towards the news team to raid them ever since day one north korea and the news team have been beefing this entire event because confusion lied about north korea in the first episode but the thing that did it the most for north korea is what confusion said in front of all the leaders at the un meeting yesterday think just come uh come r us huh well north korea took that personally north korea and their ally japan completely obliterated the news station and finally put an end to the fake news spreading on the server over in north america day three for them starts with an important conversation with president br and coconut b hello president hello president this is uh the big man c be speaking c speaking we need to have a talk we need have a talk mr president how can i help you bravo do you love america i love america that's why i want that's why i'm president coconut b yeah but bravo who made you president who made you president i mean koko makes a point bra kind of self-elected himself as president and there needed to be a proper election we've had a lot of turmoil we've had a lot of bloodshed i think it's time to call for a ceasefire and i think we should have a reelection and whoever wins should become president let's let america decide who they want to lead we should do a reelection we'll have a poll and we'll have everybody have their notes we'll have a mailbox and we'll have a person that is third party running the election i think i can agree to that br raided aadia and coconut be tried raiding the president yesterday the only way peace would be restored in the usa is if there was a fair election and so kokonut be met with president br and his men to discuss how they were going to hold this election and right off the bat there was argument because this election could easily be rigged and no one wanted that would considerably rigged if it was not in discord shut the hell up not even involved all right i'm putting myself involved i decided to step in because there needed to be a third party running things and we couldn't agree on if the election should be held in aadia or the united states territory so both groups agreed on a coin flip if coconut b wins the coin flip the election would be held in aadia if president bralo wins the election would be held in the united states i'll be blue i'll be blue let's fancy or spin it or you spin it you spin right guys coco is blue and br is red this is for home field advantage here we go good luck boys one clap usa usa usa usa roll oh all right that is for coconut b coconut b is the winner it was now official kokona b won the coin flip and the election we be held in his territory giving him homefield advantage have your men stp their sets let's do this thing we'll be there we'll be there at morning okay sounds good we'll prepare for you guys see you guys soon make america great again welcome to election day it was a very crucial day for the americans as the voters piled into the election building after all the fighting and the wars between these two groups it was the first time both acadia and the united states sat down together on peaceful terms both sides understood that america would drastically change after this election and so we separated the voters on different sides and it was actually looking like it was going to be a very close vote there were an even amount of people on both sides so one by one we begin to count the votes cowboy you're good silver back good a coup you're good darius you're good p you're good darth you're good m everyone line up for bravo j super bombar devil you're good next up next up eclipse you're good the voting was over and now it was time to reopen the building and bring in all the americans for the final reveal thank you all for joining the election today you all have casted your vote for a good cause this was a very close vote the winner won by two votes the winner and your new president cut b coconut b had done it koko was now the newly elected president of the united states i am the new president we will make this country again country again america is now one america is now one presid br will be my vice pleas and we have merged that's one it start after the election a new un meeting was scheduled with all the leaders but this would be a very important meeting as it would be the last meeting before the hostage event one of these world leaders would be obtaining a nuke later in day three and a lot of leaders feared if ot got a hold of this nuke everyone would be in danger it's it takes like 10 seconds and your base is gone it throw they throw it the nuke comes down it's blown up it's it's gone it's vaporized okay it's dangerous we need to take control of this thing we all need to bend together okay if the main concern is harvest holding on to the nuke how do you all feel about the un holding on to the nuke absolutely not absolutely absolutely everyone in favor of an emergency meeting after the competition later but during this meeting vice president of brazil tdy wanted to speak up about the unjust ways the un has been treating brazil because remember the un has continuously entered south american territory attacking brazil without anyone knowing every time i don't you i want you to take i throw the right here because i don't i don't like you and don't trust you when you is bad why don't you trust us what's your you qu killing my people on south america every day s they start we just let everyone shoot us and do nothing and not have any resources just want to talk and you shoot my people every time i try to talk like here i got killed the first day the second day i don't have voice brazil don't have voice in this event now this was real this wasn't the brazil leader role playing brazil actually felt like they were not being included in this event no one cares about bra speaking you know you have a voice but here yeah but my people are chilling in the fava and you and guys call me to fa and shoot everyone i think this is a personal issue i think you guys hadle this after brazil was complet completely ignored and swept under the rug remember all the leaders think brazil are violent people and are lying because they were the ones who shot up the first un meeting but little does everyone here know toddy is speaking the truth and the un started this war the un were the ones secretly attacking brazil but once again everyone excused brazil and they weren't able to expose the un but there is one country who did listen in the background there was one country who recognized that brazil was being treated unfairly here and they were going to change that there was complications with the nuke some leaders decided they wouldn't use it if they got it and many others said they would but coconut b remembered how ot screwed him over during the raid yesterday on bralo these traders these traders i think i could speak for everybody in here when i say oil team this isn't a pup server this is fancy orbs charity event these people form their 40 man groups with their 10,000 hour players and they think they can come in here and bully us like they do with all the other servers i say no i ask every country of the world to join me and getting that nuke button and eliminating ot off the server we must restore balance in this world if you stand with me you stand against violence and against bullies world readers come to the center if you say down with ot this entire event ot has been the villains of the server attacking every country without resistance or punishment madagascar north korea mexico antar ia russia and aradia the world leaders realized it was finally time to come together because quite frankly that was the only way ot could be defeated take your stand and bre aad i'm all right what's up guys we're at undisclosed location because we got raided news team got raided sorry that won't happen again all right into the news so uh coconut b has won the election over former president bral and now he leads the united states of america uh congratulations to president coconut b uh he now owns america and another shocking news story harvest is gathering all the w leaders to raid ot this is going to be the biggest battle of the century we got a bro you want to nuke us we get it we get it what you say man you want everyone to vote and you want everyone to vote ot so they'll nuke us also we can't forget nuclear war at 8:00 p.m. est be there or be square it was 1 hour before the hostage events all countries were getting geared up and ready for this allout war and just to give you a recap this is how the hostage event works my location will be somewhere random on the map no one knows where yet a country must break me out of my building with guards and escort me back to their base whoever succeeds i give them the nuke but because my location is live on the map everyone on the server will know where i am and everyone will be attempting to do the same thing it's less than 1 minute until the hostage event starts i've placed myself in the top right of russia a very abandoned sulfur cory far enough away from all the countries the admins for this event are my guards and there's five floors with guards on each level once the guards are cleared any team can grab me and start escorting me away it's nice to have absolutely no cover like do i use the stairs hey guys have fun bro there's someone coming guess i'm coming i'm first i'm first sit down kid so far it was quiet it was too quiet for now only a few stragglers were pulling up to the escort base but we knew the entire server was making their way over oh there oh my god l to 10 oh my god scared you're going to die oh my god boys oh my god two 10 there oh yeah people are coming get ready get ready guys the early birds who got to the base first were getting established around the perimeter no one wanted to be the first one to push in but they wanted to be the first to claim their spot around the tower everyone was making carefully calculated decisions as there was only one shot to get this right yep first fl's gone first floor is gone all right first floor's gone second floor you're up oh my god a new huge team oh my god whose team is this uh okay ot is here boys ot is here it it is it is ot it is and an honor to serve a long time ot arrived at the event and was now eyeing out the building france was the only other country on the opposite side so ot was here very early and that's when ot decided to push into the building first and this could be very bad for all the other countries thir floor oh i r all you're mine let's go where we going where we going boys let's go take me out let's go get me out of here get me out of here boys ot was the first team to capture me so this group must take me to their base in the middle east this was not good for the rest of the world but we still had to somehow get out of this building alive we're going back to ot's base we're going to the middle east all all all tell me when we're tell me when we're going i'll stay here we got to hold it we got it we got melo melo you're my main guy i'm following we're going to your bas me i think you got me first so melo i'm following you okay okay you're going to follow me at this point everyone was feeling the pressure including ot looking at their body language they had no idea how to escape this building alive as all the other countries were slowly surrounding the base and that's when ot decided screw it we're just going to send this let's go let's go go go go go follow me follow me the entire world could now see my tracker moving live on the map and since i announced who took control of me the server knows it's ot on the move this is what every country leader feared ot winning the hostage event and receiving the nuke the world leaders needed to act fast or else we'd be in the middle east in no time ot wasn't alone in this event at today's un meeting brazil felt like their voice wasn't heard so ot said hey the whole world is against us too why don't we team up together ot and brazil formed as one to win the hostage event all 100 of them created a pink and colorful kit and surprised the world by teaming together min mini 130 in the sky in the sky okay okay thank you for saving me with ot oh my god oh my god we're being we're being bombed we're being bombed oh my god follow me follow me follow me oh we're going to get cut off we weren't just about to get cut off though we were about to walk right into a trap we were about to run through traan we're about halfway there guys holy oh we're in afghanistan territory oh we're running into landmines guys you brought us to a land holy oh my god oh my god yeah snuffy i'm i'm with you snuffy i'm with you snuffy snuffy i'm following you this was the first miscalculation ot made in the event and everyone was freaking out not knowing what to do we had accidentally ran into trapist stand territory and now we were stuck in the middle of a minefield the war why why' you bring us to afghanistan boys what were we thinking what were we thinking go to the road go to the road go to the road and that road was exactly where trapin wanted us to go because now they had a clear highway to bomb us from the skyf road don't cl together you're going an h me don't cl together don't cl together holy go them down shoot all the minis oh ot was losing a lot of members from the landmines in the air strike attacks but there was still a solid core group escorting me at the front and at this point all the world leaders realized they couldn't catch up they had to cut ot and brazil off instead we're almost there boys we're almost home we defend our base oh shoot i think they might be jump something el in the hill we're winning in the hill we're b ambushed oh my god we're being ambushed i'm with you snuffy i'm with you snuffy's down where do i go where do i go i need someone to tag me i need to be tagged all right liam i'm following you liam i'm i'm on you liam liam you got me you got me liam where are we going liam so dead who am i folling all right june june june got me june got me time follow me let's go i'm going i'm going go the open the door open the door let's go open the door get in get in let's go ot and brazil had done it they had won the hostage event and we now about to receive the nuke juny president of brazil was the final person to tag me and bring me in ot's base ot and brazil had formed as one group and since the first person that tagged me from the group was an ot member juny was allowed to bring me to ot's base since they identified as one j oh my god jun come down here man come down here you were the the last person to escort me and you got me inside the base looks like brazil and ot teamed up for this to use ot's base so but you are the the owner of this nuclear bomb now i like to go over a few things with you so i'm going to give you the nuke you can do whatever you want with it you can give it to another person you can give it to another team oh my god it's a smoke grenade so wherever you throw it that's where the nuke will drop an aircraft will come in it takes like 45 seconds and it goes boom everything everything everything in the area goes boom but yeah here we go june here we go that is the nuclear bomb in your hands oh oh my god let's go congrats guys congrats and after that juny the president of brazil handed the nuke off to ot which was a great amount of trust considering this is a brand new alliance but this would strengthen the relationship between ot and brazil but could handing off this nuke to ot be a mistake on brazil's end we're going to find out today remember i hate youan youan i know you guys you guys here i hate you i'm coming mother oh now ot winning the hostage event was the worst possible outcome for everyone else on the server the most dominant group now had the most powerful weapon on the server and the vibes were very low on day three and i'm not kidding this was a very dark day for the event because that nuke was the only hope of defeating ot and now that opportunity is gone there was only one other option for ot to be defeated and that was for every country around the world to team up and raid ot at once if all countries could combine their powers together and raid ot before they use the nuke it's the only chance the world has at stopping them which brings us to antarctica you see antarctica invited all the world leaders to meet on this continent everyone thought that antarctica was eliminated out of this event on day one because ot raided them and it was reported on the news but little did we know that antarctica was still playing and in the background they were preparing for this moment to get their revenge on ot antarctica was in the background this entire time staying hidden waiting for the perfect moment to strike and now was the time it was like an illuminati meeting the strongest leaders coming together in a very private and secluded area to discuss one of the most important events that will change the direction of the server representatives from the united states rome australia greece mexico the un france antarctica north korea and even tristan had to form a plan on how they were going to raid the strongest team on the server yeah ot needs to be removed off the server i think uh a strategy to raate ot is really simple all of us come together at the same time we all mobilize our units is one and we push back ot forces as we move in we all set up our raid bases next to each other while we cover each other when all the raid bases are set up for all the world countries we merge raid onto ot and foundation wipe them get him the off the server ot is a threat to everybody on the server okay they are a group of the best pvpers in rust they're the best clan in rust has been proved multiple times in multiple different fancy or videos they can take me out they can take you you you cage maram they can't take my ass i'm buil different built different so everyone should prepare everyone get kits rockets whatever you can bring as much as you can to this raid yeah i mean if we just all pummel in from different sides ot won't be able to do anything but what matters is all of us are there at the same time and we're all using our firepower to push ot back if we go separate they'll pick us off we can't let that happen we can't give them a chance we won't even let them breathe that's the point of numbers right guys 2 hours and 39 minutes from now okay perfect. agree gather rockets gather kits gather as many people as you can and so the entire server went to work that night 2 hours and 39 minutes 2 hours and 39 minutes to craft as many explosives prepare all weaponry and each country to assemble their soldiers for war which now brings us to rome emperor of rome harvest completed the construction of the c ofam invited all leaders in their armies to come together for a speech the final speech before the biggest raid in rust history and so slowly country after country poured into this massive building and equipped blue armor the color of trust and loyalty in order for this raid to work every country must put their differences aside and trust one another with their rockets weapons and ammunition as all the countries arrived in rome the speech for the biggest raid in rust was about to be given this was a beautiful moment in gaming history not a single person in this room tried messing up this moment to troll or killing everyone with a grenade everyone in this room realized how big of a moment this is for rust hello world how are you all doing today on this fine day it's quite simple everybody we have gathered you all here in this discord in this server to bring balance and restore purpose in this server as i look out into the crowd and i look into the eyes of all these metal face masks i look in your eyes and i see ambition i see purpose i see determination and it's with that same energy everybody we are going to take out oil team and we're going to decimate them off the server i am with you and you are with me they have the nuke but they don't realize we have the atomic bomb we are the nuke my f take let's go let's go let's go ot knew this attack was coming and gave raiders respect meaning when the first explosive goes off that's when the raid starts and that's when they'll start fighting back a very honorable move by them but little did everyone know this was just a buy time go ahead over you see vice president bro didn't go to that raid in fact he stayed in america during that speech as he looked around the country of what used to be his land taken by coconut b in the election and now coco was giving the speech for the biggest raid taking the spotlight you see that was supposed to be braw but then he remembered he owed a favor during the battle of america braw was saved by ot and stopped mexico and aadia from raiding the us ot was there for bra when he needed them the most so he was going to do the same for them all of the loyal soldiers under bral's presidency stayed back with him and refused to fight with coconut b br may not have presidency but he's sure as hell had loyal soldiers br was going to betray the world by doing this but he wasn't the only team about to help ot because brazil was right there doing the same thing i mean brazil and ot work together to win the nuke how could they not ot tanza told both of these teams exactly where to meet in the northern parts of africa brazil and bra's men didn't speak the same language but they both understood the assignment brazil we are with you stop that's what is this brazil where's br where's br oh come on what's up br right here oh how's it going i little bit confused right now on the same side yeah meanwhile at the raid all countries had built their raid bases and were in position seconds away from rocketing this will be a new record for russ for the biggest raid in history there are 200 raiders 50 defenders 100 players from br and brazil about to counter there are appr imately 350 to 400 players all at this rate but for ot this was not good because the nuke is somewhere still in this base hidden in a small locked box this base is going to be destroyed no matter what but the only thing that matters is finding this nuke three two one let's walk with that bo out boys let's go i will find i will find i will keep figh it on till the end i will fight to live i will fight to live i will fight until the day i again come on let away changes in the airide make i feel the worldall was backing down the w down the ot's base was being destroyed there was nothing they could do because of the pure amount of rockets hitting their base a giant hole was made exposing all of ot's loot which allowed raiders to start pushing in all of the countries were looting ot's loot as a form of payback after all the times ot has raided and looted them one of the raiders were even able to break the main tc in ot's base we have tc we have tc destroyed tc destroyed at this point it looked like ot was going to lose but when nighttime hit things started to changed because brazil and bra's men came to the raid and that reinforcements was helping i saw the man braal himself with my own two eyes and there he was at the top of ot's base with his former american soldiers shooting down at all the raiders because of that night time and brazil and bra's men coming to the support of ot they were slowly able to repair the base as the raiders couldn't see in the darkness and by morning time all the countries would run out of rockets and this raid would be declared over on day three of global warfare ot proved why they're called the best clan in rust bra paid back the favor he owed to them with brazil standing by their side a massive wall of ggs were sent in the chat that day because although ot defended the raid against the entire world history was made un rust today and that was something that everyone could acknowledge now despite ot stealing their base there were still hundreds of players pouring into the core of their base looting their boxes breaking tc and getting out with tons of weapons ot still took a massive hit and lost tons of loot from that raid but did someone loot the small box with a nuke that's all that mattered is did someone get the nuke but after that raid the server needed a restart because the amount of action that took place in one area and unfortunately this is where our story ends for coconut b there was nothing left for koko to accomplish i mean just think about how grand his story is he started in a small humble town of a few villagers we got to get this town growing to go on to lead the american civil war it's either you're with me or you're against me to then being a general and leading the battle of america t winning the presidency of the united states i am the new president and finally giving giving the speech and commanding the biggest raid in rust history let's rock with that clock out boys let's go and so with 20 seconds left until the restart koko spent his final seconds with the very people who started this thing with him surrounded by the soldiers of acadia hey good meeting all of you guys man hey it was a godamn pleasure fighting with you guys man it was a godamn pleasure everybody bye everybody fun i'm hopping off the server it's been a godamn honor guys thank you so much for helping me out and and playing on my team and building aadia it's been a wild last 3 days everybody i love you goodbye the only question on everyone's mind after that raid was did someone get the nuke after hundreds of rockets poured into this base and countless players flooding into loot their boxes did ot still have that nuke and it's time to find out yo dling yo yo can i can i see it do do do you have it secured come in here holy it's been in this box the whole time yep it never moved yep that is that is truly impressive the whole world in my hands right now fancy the whole world in my hands fancy just know before we do this before we do this we don't live by anybody's rules we call the shots we make the wars and so it was confirmed ot still had possession of the nuke the final un meeting was called and this would determine which country would be nuked which country would be completely wiped off the server from the first ever nuke and rust take a seat please guys welcome to the emery meeting well said well saido this meeting was requested by ot ot would you like to take the floor and let everyone know why you called this meeting hello hello welcome everybody welcome welcome so as you all know uh we possess the the one thing that everybody wants right now the nuke despite what's been said in chat people talking saying they got the nuke the nuke is ours and the nuke is secure it's in our base let's go around the world let's let's hear your case what do you guys have to offer oil team rome will start rome will start so i have a proposition for you guys what's the place that causes all the issues what brings us all the drama what gets us talking to each other causing conflicts and not resolving anything it's this place right here the nuke nuke the un take it out no more things no more conflicts we will be with each other we will not be violent i can't see each other anymore all right where's brail where is brazil step up brazil here and then ot called down brazil to give their thoughts on who should be nuked and what completely shocked me and something i've never seen in russ before is juny the president of brazil brought his own translator to the meeting since the first day we tried to speak here in the mid and the un has neglected like all the our rights to speak here and besides that our vice president got killed in the first day juny was doing it brazil was finally exposing the un in front of all the leaders so we try to try to talk again we try to contact att to un to resolve all the issues they didn't want to so i need to i need to ask you do you really trust the un do you really trust their their means to do all the things no and one by one ot members were f1 killing to respawn back at their base the decision was already made the un was going to be nuked in the case of nuclear or radiological fallout people ming around potential targets such as military bases and chemical plants may be advised to evacuate ot switched their armor to blue because that's when they realized they were the ones bringing peace to the server they switched from their iconic red barrel chest plate to a blue one because the un didn't deserve to represent blue anymore ot traveled all the way through africa across the atlantic ocean and met with brazil and south america they were going to do this together you're not going to need that much listen all that matters is we get it off it doesn't matter if we die afterwards if we get it off it's done we don't care about the blute we don't care about anything we just care about the statement right yeah guys let's go we need everybody let's go let's west go west guys go west go west brazil was already at the un's walls waiting for ot to bring the nuke and together they would fight through to get to the un's main base okay this is it guys this is what all the work has been the ra to this the hostage rescue everything open it up listen listen cut right cut right and hook the walls cut right and hook the walls listen here's what we have to do everybody get out of the bottom get out of the bottom i'm going to al we're going to open this door and then we're going to buck at the external that's in there so we can wall maybe this is the push this is the push we got to go can you wall h we got to go we ot dling the war general had the nuke in his hands he was going to be the one that throws this and it was at this point i finally understand what you meant dling it all makes sense now and you try to tell me from the start it's the very first thing you told me when i met you at the tugboat war never changes fancy war never changes we don't live by anybody's rules we call the shots we make the wars peace he threw it he threw it let's go oh my godun a oh oh my god oh my god my god wow look at it you is gone the nuk look at it bro it's climbing up oh god it's g good ridd oh my god oh my god look can you see it now jesus let's go let's go let's go let's go i'm building the new i am brazil finally ended the war against the un it was over there was no more corruption brazil had won number ot had done the world a favor that day by nuking the un which brings me to my next point was ot actually the villains of the server yes they raided an it attacked numerous countries but what about the good things that they did they helped restore peace in europe by raiding russia they were the only group to comfort brazil when they felt left out of the event and as we just witnessed ot listened to the world and nuked the un ending their corruption to the server i don't know but let me know your thoughts in the comments after that nuke it seemed everything went back to a peaceful state everyone forgave ot after that and weren't even mad that they lost the raid because history was made unrust on this day there were no more wars or politics now that they when was gone it finally seemed that peace was restored back on the server so with that being said i think it's a great moment to see how all of our character stories end the leader of the russian hashtag clan who was bullying the peaceful farmers of europe actually changed his ways and ended up joining the farmers we came to a conclusion now spinky is one of us he became a farmer done a lot of thinking and i decided that it was time to come over here and make amends conrad look look out here bro you did it you said out exactly what you said and you established an entire fun roleplay community here man the king of africa diamond kid retired from his leadership after losing the battle of africa and built pyramids for him and his remaining warriors to be exiled finally did it welcome to the first floor final meeting room floor oh this is supreme leader of north korea porgi was the only remaining leader from his country but also retired to build atlantis around the underwater labs how long have you been working on this i don't want to know fancy i don't want to know oh i'm going to grab all my civilians and we're all going to hide in underwater labs muy doala the director of the un was emotionally scarred after watching everything she built be completely destroyed after the nuke but she and her team still had hope moving forward honestly fancy i think this is unforgivable i think the good guys can always find a reason to keep going and that's what we're going to keep doing will jum who we saw a few times in this video actually ended up not being wium instead it was youtuber mimo wium was never on this he's never this entire time he was using a voice changer and was infiltrating the roman empire antarctica would go on to make igloo hotels for anyone wanting to take a vacation to their continent now that the world knew antarctica was still playing and not eliminated by ot on day one they would see a lot more tourists brazil and ot celebrated their success in south america not only defeating the un and winning the brazilian war but defending a raid against the entire world if these two teams hadn't merged together none of this would be possible and finally we end the video with the same person who started it president bra bra would go on to raid mexico one final time in hopes to eliminate them but ultimately failed the america versus mexico war ended in a stalemate all the wars deaths politics the fighting it was all for nothing it's a little life lesson because no one came up on top but both teams lost so much out of the this war thank you for watching the biggest video on my channel ever if you did make it to this point i think it's worthy asking you to subscribe if you haven't because this took me 3 months to edit there's so many stories and lore that happened on the server that i unfortunately wasn't able to show in this video so i want to ask the players if you are a player in the event comment a story down below what's a memory from this event or a story that you could share with someone in the comments below this was also a charity event where we raised $43,000 for st jude the tiltify link is still active and in the description if you'd like to donate well guys thank you for listening to my voice for like the last 2 hours holy this is like my final voice over so with that being said that's it for global warfare that is until next time",2023-11-03T14:55:11Z
EzKSYgC7Oc0,Rust Last to Leave the Island Keeps the Server #2,492874,10764,720,0 days 00:40:37,i've gathered 100 players and put them on this island and the last person to leave it keeps it everyone on the server only has one life and during pvp phases if you die you're eliminated so that means eventually only one person will be left on the island and keeps the entire island how do they keep the island well i'll be giving the winner the password and ownership of my server or if they don't want it they can just sell it back to me for money how will players survive the social experiment when one life is on the line alliances will start to form people will betray each other to get one step closer but only one person can win the island in the end i told all the islanders to go to the meeting area for a mandatory island meeting a new assumed time to welcome all the islanders into this event alright welcome guys to the second island experiment one of you will be winning the server i'm gonna be transferring you to ownership so you quite literally will keep the island as your prize you all soon we'll be fighting to the death until there's one person alive and there are no rules do whatever it takes to be the last person standing you can form teams you can betray destroy people's buildings do whatever it takes to be the last person standing i'm king of the mountain the islanders left the meeting area now could explore the new islands now on this island there are many landmarks like shops for the economy a prison the arena and a giant mountain that overlooks the island now that the islanders had the entire island to explore let's go meet some of the contestants the hobby in the chat nobody put humvee in the chat what the hell is this is this racial wait that doesn't make sense oh my god jesse you're back i'm back man if you guys don't know in the video jesse here was in the last island video and he was a strong member of the island now already i noticed people were playing dirty and destroying buildings so innocent players couldn't get started hold up wait wait wait wait wait wait why'd you miss the meeting t guy you're lucky you should have died but i gave you a free pass you know that i'm giving you a free pass cheat guide that better not happen again oh oh guys come on guys leave him alone what do you guys why are you guys doing that package why you guys doing that just a man trying to put down a tea farm sorry i was distracted i was trying to focus on the t's you know and that's reality of this island there are no rules players can backstab their teammates betray lions is doing whatever means necessary to make it to the end but all hope isn't lost because there are good people on the island who will bring balance against these toxic players whoa who said that who was it snitch right now who said that no no go ahead and repeat yourself what did you just call me okay all right guys um so lawless guys i'm putting the first bounty on the kid named lawless harvest yes you could you you keep busy this time i'm normal you you keep asking video now harvest actually killed baz here in the last island video but now he's a changed man and is trying to redeem himself and it's his only goal to get bass to the end and make up for what he did in the last island experiment all right holy crap what is this big base here hey stop saying that stop all right lawless you know what you know what lawless you want to play like that all right you want to play like that lawless now i did mention there was a prison on this island and it's meant for people like lawless here he kept calling me the r word for some reason so i decided to lock him up there will be punishments if people aren't behaving on this island but he wasn't the only player in the prison bralo was in the last island experiment as an admin but he was caught cheating and giving players spawns admin liu on the last island video justice on this island will be served foreign you are a bad admin than the last island video so i had to put you in here so you don't cause any trouble ask what you think fancy that's what you think all right since braulo was locked up and no longer an admin for the island i hired a new admin db this is my new replacement admin and he will be replacing you because you're a piece of because the last island video you were cheating with confusion so uh say hello to tv with brolo in jail i made db my new admin to help for this event meanwhile my other admin gluman was running his popular shop gloomin's good where players could trade and buy items to survive on the island 's making that noise bro what the hell we actually have a clown on the server bro chuckles the silly clown what are you doing man you are creepy as creepy as i'm not gonna lie i hope you die in the next pvp stage but good luck who's building on the top of this hill oh it's jackson i do like your mountain oh it's i okay he's on my team oh god wait a second the two biggest solo chads are teaming up iocane yexim on this island there's a parkour arena where i'll randomly spawn a crate this could be a huge advantage for the islanders since there's tier 3 weapons in this crate but you can die to fall damage so the players are gambling their lives for this crate the first person to complete it gets the bradley crates oh my god this this crate's insane whoever gets this will have a huge advantage i'm not even kidding you you want to get someone's someone's so close already no way someone's already so close fancy wait who is this yo fancy fancy wait i don't feel safe can you can he make the jump oh my god oh my god somebody got the crate he got an m249 bro someone already got an m249 bro from the crate dude oh my god i'm not kidding there is an m249 in the bradley crate dude whoever just did that has some serious skill he just one tapped that entire parkour course now another group on the island are four members of ot the best clan in rust they're known for their insane pvp skills and the entire island knows that there are threats but i found them farming and they told me something very interesting how many of you are on the server right now okay fancy you're gonna build this you're gonna tell this okay okay you actually have a secret agent okay in the island as well who is pretending to be solo but it's actually very wrong with us it appears that ot has taken extra measures to ensure they're winning by initiating a spy ot knows they have a big target on their backing when pvp has enabled people would go after them but there's a secret fifth member of ot named dot dot dot who's secretly located on the other side of the island so who really are you dot dot dot who really are you okay my name is climber i am from the ot lens so you're an ot member undercover on this island i'm a spy one can say all right well it was interesting you're on my radar after you got that m249 because i know if you're an ot member with the best gun in the game it's uh it's gonna be trouble so good luck are you with us hey man i just want to make sure you're getting cozy in there i just want to make sure you're cozy in there yeah yeah it's it's pretty nice you know you guys left me to sell somebody you lived in this on the floor yeah you can clean up after yourself what is this whoa diamond deals welcome to diamond deals

a good this is a good combination right now in the first grace period people came together by building shops churches farm bases but soon pvp would be enabled until 15 players are eliminated kyle had an enable pvp 96 people are alive let's go until 15 people die i'd say pvp is enabled pvp has been enabled the leader of ot was the first person eliminated now this was a complete shock to the entire island no one would expect the leader of ot tiger first tanza already died holy holy the leader of ot just got killed in the first pvp stage no they killed t guy tom no no we're losing people bodies no another ot members died holy bro what is happening this pvp stage this shit's crazy no humvee humphy died oh i found your tv what are you doing i was and then someone shot us with the silence thing and i couldn't save him we had no meds the first pvp phase was brutal and innocent people were eliminated but it reminded the islanders that not everyone will win this the characters you see in this video will all face a similar fate except for the one person who out survives the 100 players at the end but during that pvp phase bralo went missing from his jail cell i forgot to check on the prisoners i gotta see how they're doing hey fancy hey all right something happened bro what it was an explosion wait what do you mean yeah it was scary bro it's exploding in here like wait what the where'd rollo go wait braulo is not in his jail cell anymore harvest we want don't do it what did you see wait where's the other kids flawless okay lawless uh what happened here okay so there was like three other guys and they came in here and they wait we had the doors blocked up no no one was even able to get in hold on what they did oh my god barky why'd you jump down there no where are you going okay let's go go get him don't go find the porky three other guys i don't know their names they came in here they said free brawlow and uh you know they had some c4 and they kind of blew this thing up and then bralo said i'm free the local islanders who heard it go down and formed me apparently it was harvest who helped bralo escape we now had a dangerous prisoner on the loose on the island since two ot members were already eliminated during the first pvp phase i decided to look and see what happened oh hello i was waiting for you oh how are you doing hey sorry scary drink good so uh are you the are you the only ot member left bro uh we do have ding-a-ling but he's stuck at some other base what happened during that pvp stage man you lost like two of your guys off the bat i don't know our neighbors have uh aks and heavy pots we didn't expect them to have vacations it's in that base which one right there oh this one holy all right hey guys are you are you home what's up what's up if you look right there see you guys stuck in our race yeah we have ot stuck in our base oh my god you're the one who killed no teas before too oh my god wait there's actually an ot member stuck in your base diddling are you okay down there for pvp so you guys are the group that has killed two ot members and you have trapped one of the ot members in your base you're defeating the best clan in rust right now what do you got how are you guys doing this is better than them honestly yeah yeah wait dinling says he wants to answer that what is it yeah go ahead they have a they have a roof beak because with a heavy potter foreign they didn't trap me i walked in here oh okay okay holy with two members of ot already eliminated and another stuck in a base it wasn't looking good for them but i had a funeral to attend to on the island i met humvee when this game was first starting over by the docks he was he was having trouble hearing because uh his discord was too loud and you know we had a fun time we sought out to make a basic leather and we did and you know he was on the base when he was viciously murdered by a silenced ak and in his final request says he was lying on the floor about to perish he asked me to recite the martin luther king speech oh no five score years ago a great american in whose symbolic shadow we stand today at this degree came as a great beacon light of our lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness have a dream i have a dream oh man let's go boys let's go justice for humvee justice for humvee hello my god oh you're in a uh tough situation right now chocolates oh how you doing how you doing oh my god dude what is that a clown house sign that's just my house do you like my house as i was going around checking on the island i came across dot dot dot again and soon discovered how smart this kid actually is dot dot dot knew he had to be undercover in this event so we built in the trees staying hidden away from the rest of the island ah look what is it box oh my god oh my god you are insanely smart oh my god where'd you get all this bro i need you to do something right now okay i want you to skin your stuff right now to a skin that you're gonna stick to forever okay because you're in your normal gear but you're so badass you need a skin i think you're right and obviously you're in the trees so it only makes sense to go camo or something right um you're looking good ot was severely down bed and it's a position i'm not used to seeing them in they're pvp warriors and absolutely dominated the last island experiment but two of their members already died in one of the surviving members was stuck in their neighbor's base honestly it looks like ot wasn't going to survive much longer but not all hope was lost for ot just yet the secret undercover islander dot dot dot was the final hope of ot since he seemed to be thriving on his own because no one on the island knows he's an ot member it takes a massive target off his back foreign grace period is coming to an end it's time to enable pvp again until 25 more islanders are eliminated they got dingling no no plus his life both ot dingling and melo were eliminated meaning this was the end for ot on the island everyone in the chat celebrated and was happy but little do they know dot dot dot is still alive and now has to avenge his fallen team foreign how you doing boys yo you guys is this your base over here but he's hiding yeah he's hiding the second pvp phase there was a lot of action happening with a lot of people being eliminated this here is falcon and coma two content craters on the island but what's unique about them is that they're actually brothers in real life and both insane at pvp with over 10 000 hours each putting these two together is a dangerous combination says they have a stronger chemistry that no one in the island has were the brothers now there are 55 players remaining on the island the piece returned once again but i ran into coma and discovered he had lost his brother falcon in the battle what happened man what happened hey how's it going what's up lost your brother how much shaking of that and kill dang you lost your brother how are you feeling you guys uh though so i take it it's like a smile oh oh oh oh chuckles is gonna die i happen to run into beds and to my surprise he was kind of doing something big brain here what's what's going on here what is going on here oh my god you guys actually claimed the jail cells yeah oh my god okay i'm not gonna lie this is pretty big brain baz had taken over the jail since there were no prisoners left but soon it would be time to hold the second parkour challenge all right go you may go the bradley crates up go go go go go go go go go go oh my god no shot dude the bradley crate's also insane people are going there's two pets oh both people just fell yeah except was that you bro oh shot no shot no shot no shot move jesse oh my god he got it again the same guy got the bradley and it's another m249 it's another m249 the same guy who got the last crate got two m249s bro it was time for another mandatory meeting so all the islanders gathered in the meeting area but one player couldn't make it and it ended up being chuckles the clowns and i'm not gonna lie it was a very good riddance okay all right everyone can i gather your attention at the meeting area please this is important now there has been a lot of killing on this server and we need a leader of the island someone that you will be electing here how we're gonna do this is whoever has the most votes in the chat is going to be a representative we're gonna have two people come up and give their speeches on why they should be leader of the island there's a lot of confusion confusion will be an elector oh i see porgy we can do confusion in porgy all right confusion of porky i would love to run for leadership on this island and i might say there are plenty of changes that are gonna happen we're gonna make this island a great place there's been killing but there's been no organization it's all been paid it's suffering and you know what's gonna fix that a lot of mustaches ladies ladies and gentlemen i'm your presidential attire i'm fit to be a leader let me tell you my stances my first stance no elimination challenges i'll be working on that for the good of the people nobody will be eliminated

stuff at a at a discounted price maybe maybe rockets for i don't know 10 scrap a rocket i think i think something might might happen you know with the i think i think giving giving gear to the people

more thing one more thing all right they're they're coming back um i i was talking about renovations right what about shop confusion is now the newly elected leader of the island but soon after he told everyone he wanted to replace glue and shop with bralo and sell rockets and other supplies at a very cheap cost confusions alliance had made it to gloom and shop and forced him to sit down and have a chat about his new shop renovations alice and glimmons you stole my customers in the last island you brought people from my shop to your shop by sending your advertisers to my place and then when i had my own investor confusion come along and try to provide business to my shop to keep me afloat you sold me out and you know what you did you ruined my title and you got me thrown in jail and this is all your fault but while confusion's alliance was arguing over control for gloom and shot but another very important conversation was happening right outside peace you know you even get some stuff out of it too coma had found where dot dot dot lives the undercover ot member dot dot dot has been winning challenges and coma knows he's a threat and during this conversation kamu was being very sus asking for c4s from dot dot dot but soon after that conversation coma met up with youtubers iok and yaxim and they were gonna backstab dot dot i can i can eat c4 when we get to the point so yeah but we've got i've got six a4 on me as well right now so yeah i get to perform comma manipulated dot dot dot into giving him c4 for an alliance and even got authorization on his turret so he wouldn't be killed by them but como's intentions was a backstab and eliminate dot dot dot since he was a huge threat to the island the third pvp phase had started and just like always gloomy closed down his shop but little did he know lumen coma yaksim and iok immediately went over to raid dot dot dot and backstab him but coma isn't fooling anyone coma thinks dot dot dot is just another average rust player but dot dot dot is much smarter than this dot dot dot moved all of his loot before the pvp phase and secretly built a new ocean base at the edge of the island coma yaksim and ioke realized they were bamboozled and were salty that they were reversed outsmarted so they took their anger on the next nearby base and went on a rampage gameplay porky killed coma oh my god baby you did it porky easy knife you'll kill the chat out there dude jackson and i okay died oh my god oh my god pearly's got him acrylics yes oh my god piercy's dead body confusion brolo and harvest snuck into bloom and shop and we're holding the employees hostage ever since his election confusion wanted control of this shot this is my shot man thing all right the third pvp phase has now ended and more characters were eliminated and we had to end the phase early because of the hostage situation at gloom and shop wait a second goldman where's gloomin where's glooming same oh my god actually um is dead you how

challenge 10 players were remaining and we held the final meeting of the event congratulations this is the final 10 here you guys have worked a lot there's been a lot of people they've gone through to be here so you should be proud of yourselves but for the rest of this event pvp will be enabled alright now there's another rule that we must follow there's no more going back to your bases you cannot enter a base everything you must do must be outside there's no roof camping there's no going into bases everything must be on the outside grass natural so we're gonna go until there's a final three so uh with that being said seven of you will die you guys have five minutes and get in position around this island somewhere go go the fourth and final pvp phase begun with 10 players remaining but only three can go to the final elimination challenge i noticed there was a big alliance of five harvest brawlow confusion baz and koala were teaming up in the five other players were solo fighting for their lives the team of five could easily wipe out everyone but eventually they would have to break because only three people can go to the final challenge what is going on over here what are you guys doing all right looks like there is a team of five and everyone else is solo it looks like now there's eight players remaining and it's the team of five versus three solo players the solo players were scared for the lives hiding in bushes and trees knowing they were at a severe disadvantage but i presented an offer to them to lower their numbers you want to hear an offer i have for you guys if you kill one of your teammates i will give you a nice skin biz won't do it i just won't do it as bad as you know i want to die anyways pass because i i'm gonna die anyway baz a how long does he have how long let's see let's see how long let's see how long 60 seconds 60 seconds to make the decision three seconds fast it's up to you it's up to you think about this it's up to you guys i'm dying anyway i told you i'm dying anyway this is a nice skin we're going to the end all right all right yes yes take take the okay do it bears oh my god good luck bears um he did it bez did it he killed one of his teammates for his skin harvest has been eliminated everything comes full circle harvest killed baz in the first island video but made it his goal to get baths to the end in this one and now the rules are reversed baz had killed harvest to not let the pvp phase be stale i told all the players they would need to start moving or i'd reveal locations unease your belt was next eliminated in his dream of avenging humvee was short-lived i might have to uh fancy as ot still in here is ot was eliminated a long time ago while the four man was going around hunting the remaining solos koala who was in the group of four discovered the true secret of dot dot dot koala check dot dot dot steam profile now truth was revealed to the rest of the islanders that ot is still on the island everyone thought ot was eliminated at the beginning but now everyone realizes there's still a huge threat on the island and dot dot dot could not make it to the final three dot dot dot has been an undercover ot member this entire time that that's why it makes sense why he was able to give both parkour crates with the m249s but with that being said i'm gonna give out some coordinates uh so the group of four is at the fancy sun that's all i'm gonna say since they are a group i'm not gonna call out the other solos everyone is on the arena side by the way everyone is on the arena side they're literally in the trees there's trees and blow them up so they fall down oh they're shooting the trees right now he's throwing thank you oh confusion died confusion died oh my god oh my god target kills confusion he got his revenge they were election leaders against each other in the in the politic war two more people need to die two more baz bralo koala porgy and dot dot dot porgy goes down oh my god dot dot dot executed him it's a okay there's a group of three and the final ot player dot dot dot all dot dot dot has to do is kill one of the three members in the trio alliance to secure his spot before they kill him he just has to be sneaky and just kill one person he got a kill he killed braulo he killed brolo oh my god oh my god all right we have our final three bralo has been killed dot dot dot survived these three contestants have been through everything and of all 100 people that were on this island koala have managed to out survive everyone nobody put harvey in the chat what the hell is this i would love to run for leadership on this island there's not a lot of us left sad to say that but yeah it's fast you're going to the end all right i don't deserve to be in your fantasy ladies and gentlemen presidential attire but it wasn't over yet because the final elimination challenge took place in the arena a final free-for-all fight with all the items they've gathered throughout this event the winner of this fight wins the island 30 seconds to go claim your spot go there is no teaming if we see you team we'll put you down may go ahead and enable pvp it's on boys this challenge is started now immediately bazen dot dot dot traded shots decided to push it fez killed the ot members to bez versus kamala the little debas know koala was nearby and had a high ground advantage well

dSrTzkyIPqQ,The Rise and Fall of the Largest Kingdom in Rust - A Rust Movie,1086063,25967,1636,0 days 00:36:42,welcome to village warfare invited of tons of villages around the map politics will arise wars will break out between civilizations and everyone will fight to be the dominant village now forcing over a hundred craters on one server is going to make for insane content but what i didn't realize is there would also be a lot of drama that comes with it all right gentlemen today is day two of village warfare for the past 24 hours the players on the server have been going at it all the villagers around the map are currently at war so you guys need to protect me at all costs does everyone understand yeah yeah so we're we're first gonna visit king harvest the victim on this server all right everyone now everyone out everyone let's move let's move by far the biggest kingdom on the server was reigned by a creator named harvest he's taking control of the entire top left island and built a wall surrounding the entire perimeter not only does he have villages within these walls but he has over a hundred people living in this kingdom and it was time to meet the king rick can you bring us to the throne room yes sir follow me ladies and gentlemen please clear the way for sir fancy night and his crew this is king harvest and as you can tell he has a lot of influence in his humble abode you jump to the front please is that mimio use me mr fancy villagers out the door please all right we need to get these turrets unhooked as well please they are the turret look at the turrets no we see i see a wire going through them there ferguson can you unhook the turrets absolutely my ladies listen all right calm a down harvest all right we're just here to talk that's killing the harvest happening excuse me what did you say you are in the king's castle are you not i i'm like 99 sure that's me why you could hear fancy orb why are you visiting the island we're here to get some information looking to see who's causing the most trouble on this server we thought you might be able to give us that answer we've not been successful in causing any violence any hectic any action on the server we've just been trying to build our wall stay in our lane and not raid anybody else but for people who have been causing issues look at the e13 on the map those sweats with their vending machines according to harvest another group that was causing trouble in the server was e13 also known as the hashtag clan this is a team of content creators but not just normal content creators these guys are chats this group specializes in two things pvp and building the best known building youtubers are on this team decided to build an op clan base instead of a village not to mention they also play on heavy pvp related servers so their appearance on a lighter content server was quickly known those are definitely the guys you're looking for so as you can see they have the sulfur quarry and we have control of it as well or we had then they blew up all our tcs they took control of it now they have unlimited gunpowder there's a soul for corey on this map which gives eddie bilge on the server a huge advantage yesterday on day one of village warfare harvest this kingdom and hashtag clan fought all day for control disc corey but no matter how many villagers harvest had the hashtag clan had better pv peers and took control of it that alone proves how dominant this clan is they are the most stacked the most loaded on the server so and they have all the sweats all the pvps now we're gonna go on our way here and we're gonna go check out e13 how fancier we were gonna kill you as you saw but but since you just want peace i have heavy plate we're not gonna try and kill you you guys are free to leave all right boys let's go let's go everyone up holy holy all right we'll back up thunder most you need to get these people either way shooting no shooting hey no shooting no shooting no shooting no shooting no shooting your way that was really sketchy boys as soon as we walked into their kingdom i saw the turrets hooked up i knew it was gonna happen now as the host of this event i'm not allowed to play but i still wanted to get involved with the content so i made sure to greet every village on this server and i asked them the same question i asked king harvest looking to see who's causing the most trouble on this server from what i've seen i'd say harvest group you just started to give us taxes harvest all that douchebag rated this twice already harvest 100 100 i mean he took so much in the chat to us like with peasants their group is so big that they're just kind of terrorizing the whole server we need to pay taxes to stay here the entire serpa expressed their hatred towards king harvest this entire event who's been raiding villages he's been attacking innocent players king harvest lied to me in his throne room we've not been successful in causing any violence any action on the server but there was only one group left to speak to on the server that was the hashtag clan in e13 hey let's land let's land here let's land here i i talked to bullet hold up we are not here to shoot you stop running stop running we're not here we're not going to shoot you unless you shoot at us man i'm friendly i'm fine the hashtag team oh you guys live at e13 don't you yeah you're actually just the person i wanted to talk to you can you uh bring us to your base we need to have a meeting okay welcome to our welcome to our humble abode you know there's our little uh you know a little meeting room everyone's almost here everyone's almost here hello hello how are you hello how are you doing this is a youtuber named dust leader of the hashtag clan i wanted to ask you who is giving you the most issues on this server you know this might be like an ego thing but i wouldn't say anybody's given us issues i think as a village we all believe that peace means having the bigger stick and we feel we have the biggest stick what do you guys think about harvest's kingdom uh originally we were planning on being friendly but then they came in and make some assumptions that they owned the sulfur quarry which is in our area so we didn't take too kindly to that that's why we raided it and took it from them stories were starting to line up and dust also said the same thing harvested about the sulfur quarry they have the sulfur quarry now they have unlimited gunpowder alright guys so there is a current plan in motion that i would like you guys to be a part of you guys seem to be the top docs you're actually the only group here that said you don't fear anyone you said no one was giving you issues now one kingdom or one village cannot take on harvest this kingdom so i am organizing a village warfare attack every kingdom on this serve that i've spoken to that has some reputation will be attacking them together i wanted to propose this and see if you guys have to be interested in this assault we we also want to get hit though we we're uh we've been we've been preparing for an online and everything we'd be down to do it and use our rockets on it uh but we definitely want to get online also we i can help you out with that if you really do want that that's another thing we could talk about but yeah i can make sure you guys get online yes we all want that everybody's going crazy in discord even if it means giving everybody rockets i will make sure you guys get the online the plan for now awesome is for harvest to be taken out i'll invite you to a discord later tonight then uh but yeah thank you for the meeting more details soon the harvest kingdom needed to be removed from this event not only is every creator and village leader saying harvest was giving them the most problems the harvest plan to assassinate me in his throne room we were gonna kill you as you saw this is why i brought bodyguards with me when someone tries to assassinate the host of the event it's a huge red flag for me but as we were flying away from the hashtag clan's base i got a discord message from someone all right uh let's get the choppers going we've got a little personal visit to go to it's to a good friend of mine now a good friend of mine has been scouting harvest's kingdom for the past 24 hours they call him the paul revere of the server as he goes around the server on horse reporting any findings to other villages and well apparently he had crucial information to tell me foreign how are you old friend how have you been so what are you doing out here by yourself all this kingdom stuff it's i don't know if you know it's it's a headache there's so much politics harvest is going to war it's it's just a whole mess man and you mentioned harvest you know anything about him yeah no well i will say this not very nice not not a kind guy at all he needs to be dealt with uh you know you're talking about intel though yeah so i do have a little gum drop for you one of harvest's closest men are planning on betraying him what he's been in the works for a while now okay i only know about it i'm not too sure if i'm gonna be joining what is this person that is leading this effort kevin nope yeah hold on all right here you go this is really good information i appreciate this man this is actually going to help out a lot boys boys you guys realize what we've just found out fancy what was on the note man what type of information are we looking at i can't say it now i think i should so one of king harvest's men was going to betray him now this would be perfect for the organized raid that i'm building so i had to speak to the man himself an undercover youtuber by the name of mimio you are in the king's castle are you not i i'm like 99 sure that's anemia but only three people know about this intel confusion just gave me me confusion and mimio this plane had gone out to the public it could ruin everything but we needed to go back to the kingdom to find him guys stay close is remember it's dangerous here back up back up back up there it's harvesting he's here but he's he's getting ready for you is a sir thunder here not at the moment search pandemos he's at his base do you want me to bring you to his base yes yes please please okay come it's this one right here yes i believe there is a crown ceremony in five or so minutes uh which i will need to attend uh if we make it quick don't take him for more than five minutes please we'll make sure to bring it back safely he'll be fine let's go i mustn't be late for the crowning ceremony we'll make this quick sun says beautiful isn't it thunder most it's rather beautiful fancier renamed mimio and his entire plan for village warfare is to climb the ranks of harvest's kingdom undercover by changing his name and accent when he reaches the perfect moment he's going to backstab the king i'm gonna give up the voice now so our wife yeah yeah all right all right guards uh yeah get to the get to the boat let me meet me a speak over here all right mimio what's going on in the kingdom man tell me the intel there's a lot going on listen i've worked my way up from a peasant villager and i'm about to be crowned a lord at this ceremony so as i'm sure you know there's one man on this server named king harvest and he has made a lot of enemies i'm currently organizing a server-wide raid on his kingdom and i wanted to see if you're interested in partaking i can assist you with that i've been watching right next to king harvest quite a lot of time now and i can see he's not fit to be a king he's turning into a tyrant and the people aren't happy now i've heard your intentions of assassinating the king that secret is kept with me but if anything in my plan falls apart or my final guide to pull this off i'm very interested i also have access to all of the inside turrets especially in the throne room okay maybe during a meeting when all the villagers are there i can clear off and have the turrets wiped off oh my god it could be beautiful it could be beautiful but let's get you back you need to you need to get to your ceremony let's get back okay let's go boys the plan was slowly forming we're going to organize a server-wide attack on harvest removing his tyranny from the server villagers attacking from the ocean hashtag play leading the ground assault an air force squad attacking from the skies and inside men causing chaos in the village all this combined would be the biggest attack rust has ever seen everything was coming together alright everyone now we can leave the boat here also and fancy yep i'll see a thunder all right boys more information has been acquired look at that now i should probably tell you more details about this server slash event because you're probably wondering if i'm going to do something like this again and the answer is yes this is my private content server now it's not actually private because a guy named cheese in this video took it from me so my private server is open for anyone to play where every month i make a new theme on the server for the players the theme in this video was obviously village warfare and two times a year on this server i'll do a massive wipe like this where i invite hundreds of creators for an ultra content wipe in fact this summer i'll be hosting another one so follow me on twitter for updates because it's coming very soon but yeah you can join this server now and i'm always looking for videos to make on the server so only join if you'll help prioritize making content for my channel or other creators who play the server and next month in june i'll be making the theme village warfare one more time just in case anyone wants to relive this event if you search phase europe under the modded servers you'll find my server or the ips in the pinned comments below now i just learned valuable intel from mimeo but as we are flying to our next destination a disaster was about to hit the server wasn't who is rated doesn't pickle just is it lagging well no i think there's some details going on my head admin was telling me our server was being ddosed you're going to look at that if you want to take care of the car go ahead i'm lagging this as well that's uh some i think someone's trying to do the server right now if you need to take care of the server yeah if you need to take care of the server let's do that but it wasn't a ddos attack instead it was an attack on king harvest led by a group of creators people are saying that like there's tele bombing yeah you know where that is yeah their roof is completely on fire donald oh my god the server's hatred grew so much for harvest to the point where people were trying to lag him off by taking down the server and it further proved to me that harvest needed to be raided foreign harvest and i are friends i knew he wouldn't get salty if i did this because it would be great for both of our videos but he called me that night and all content aside what you're about to hear is a real discord call between us the content for them is just pvp like i talked to them in chat i don't know if you've been on the server but i talked to them in chat and been calling them out i said they provide zero content to the server this is just not good for anybody them being on the server harvest is talking about e13 aka the hashtag clan as we know the hashtag clan is op they took control soul for corey and usually play on heavy pvp servers dust is gonna rate everybody they're they're the strongest clan they are the best for your peers they are the most rock they can raid anyone that they'd like gonna kill everyone's storylines they're uh i think you should initiate a raid because when i was talking with them that's the only thing that they want in online raid we definitely want to get online also so i think you should give it to them the contents there is definitely doable if you merge these people and strategically attack but i might i might have to come back if we fail though because if they know that everyone's out to get them they will raid everybody for now okay okay i guess i'll just read them tonight or what's that plan depends on what happens depends on how uh how this coordinating goes all right let me know the hashtag claim is becoming more of a problem than we had thought i hosted this event for stories to form and all creators to go for content but the creators in the hashtag team go for pvp content which is understandable they're used to rating pvping and dominating servers but this wasn't necessarily the server for that this event is called village warfare where creators form villages with their audiences and clash it out but the hashtag clan didn't even make a village it was starting drama and creators were becoming unhappy with this group but harvest took things in his own hands harvest wasn't gonna let this group of heavy pvpiers ruin the server for every other creator instead harvest went to every notable village around the server ran by content creators and asked to put their differences aside one village wouldn't be able to take down the hashtag clan alone so harvest formed the united nations with every big village on the server and together they held a meeting to discuss what they should do with the hashtag clan i want us all to join together in grade e13 send enough rockets so we can see the other side and bring that entire base to the floor because they do not deserve a spot on this server so this will be the united nations i'm 400 discord i'm inviting all of you to it you can join no we're allies and enemies right now or some of us are some of us aren't but we need to paused it and then all join together and raid them then afterwards we can continue to be enemies if we'd like i am down for a temporary truce what do we want to do this do we want to do this tonight yeah it's higher do you want to do this as in the next like two to three hours everyone agrees yeah in the next two hours all plans suddenly changed that night every creator in this event are going for storyline content but the hashtag clan was only focusing on pvp and raiding causing every creator and village to hate them instead of a server-wide raiden harvest that suddenly changed to a server-wide raid on the hashtag clan and so every content creator and their villagers arrived to harvest's kingdom together for this raid after hours of preparation everyone pitched in their fair share of explosives to successfully read the hashtag clan and then everyone waited waited for the king to give the final speech before the raid seek one common goal to annihilate the hashtag clan they have held their spot on this server for far too long we have the rockets we have the drives to succeed and blow their base to pieces failure is not an option are you with me are you with me the biggest rate this server has ever seen was about to commence 100 players across all villages joined together to raid 15 members of the hashtag clan you see 100 players should easily pummel this base but the hashtag clan knew they were outnumbered and they decided to play dirty there's three key advantages the hashtag clan utilized to help them defend this raid first they were stream sniping the content creators before the raid they knew every detail before it even happened where the raid bases were going the colored kits the raiders were using which side the attacking team was coming from the hashtag clan was more than prepared okay sorry start let's go let's go the raid had started and the entire server was attempting to remove the hashtag clan from this event but the raiders soon discovered the second key advantage of the hashtag clan ot is here ot are we killing rt here he's at the bridge the hashtag clan recruited members of ot before this raid ot is the best clan in rust with the most talented pv peers in this game and since the hashtag clan stream sniped they had extra time to bring in more pv peers for this raid is ottery okay the raiders thought ot was countering this raid and helping them a little did they know ot was actually defending the tower all people on my team in my kingdom take over that left tower push left push left as long as we still have rockets kill anybody it was in the combo four rockets into that surface of 170. open it up now the third key advantage hashtag clint had was they were changing their steam names to the same usernames as some of the raiders by doing this the raiders think it's their teammates but little do they know it's actually an enemy in disguise legions in our raid base he just turned around and killed four of us really oh yeah allegiant scarred men they're turning on them okay so trust no legions then like none anyone you see legion killing straight away what if the villagers rating was a team named legion and everyone thought legion was betraying mid-rade but the raiders didn't know this was hashtag clan members changing their names to legion and getting on the inside with my name just letting you guys know there's another what the hell dude yeah ghosting ghosting in the biggest raid they've been doing that to us all white as the attackers realized they were running out of rockets frustration started to kick in a little kit and compound not shooting you i can't see man the sun's in my eyes and then the 100 player call went silence as everyone knew the raid was a lost hope what do you mean i think it's over we're out of kicks now they just walled in all their cuts in there possible to lose anything yeah but at this point where it's three of us pushing in because we're all dying before we even get into each other i don't think we have a virtue anymore even though there were 100 people attacking this base the unethical strategies hashtag clan pulled off was enough to defend this raid the hashtag clan news psychological warfare and was able to mentally break the raiders to the point where they thought their own teammates were betraying them they're they're turning on them kicked out of this raid right now so i've been killed from them over and over and over and over again news went around to the entire server that night that hashtag clan was unstoppable well dust how did you do it you just defended a 100 person raid honestly i gotta give a huge shout out to miami and steve they put this base together and this thing is literally 61 and zero now never been rated before this thing is absolutely insane even though it's one wall to loot yeah seriously every single person contributed it was it was awesome you know i didn't lie to you dust i told you earlier i would get you an online raid yeah i can make sure you guys get online yes we all want that everybody's going crazy in discord you absolutely did so thank you to everybody who online knows as well this is such a crazy event such a crazy grade and my only question is what's next you just defeated the entire server what do you do after that we're gonna rate the whole server harvest was right the hashtag clan was going to raid the entire server now joss is gonna rate everybody they're they're the strongest clan they have the best for vp is going to kill everyone's story lines the village warfare event is now at risk because no one is able to stop the hashtag claim but what do you do when you're king harvest everyone looked up to him to lead this raid and not only did he fail his kingdom but he failed the entire server i found him in his empty throne room not a single villager in sights and i actually felt bad for my friend fancy i i don't know how much longer you want me to last on the server fancy but i'm losing people every day harvest when i started recording today you're the most badass king on the server you had a whole throne room of lords and knights and villagers by your side but now you were left with nothing i'm naked on my i don't even have my throne don't even have my throat so stressful we're we're we're not going to last much longer as a group fancy oh who's this you have a loyal soldier come come next to me you see this man right here hello fancy although you lost majority of people there are still people who have hope you grew a massive kingdom you had over a hundred people it was a community there's laughter there was joy everyone was having a great time they saw leadership at the beginning but because you ran into the wrong people and you picked the wrong fights now kingdom is empty the streets are empty there's no laughter or joy anymore can't call yourself a king right now because no one looks at you like a king anymore now what will the king do after his kingdom has fallen and all his people abandoned but there's still few loyal soldiers still around now it's only a ticking time bomb until those guys rape every single person but you still have people like lord killer claus who hasn't given up on you there's still people who don't want to see you lose they're still people who want to be on here so we're 48 hours into this event 48 hours 96 in total we're halfway done you you can tell this to dust you can tell this to coma or if he's playing you can tell us to his entire group we'll be back i'll be back we can as long as the nodes are still there as long as there's still people in my kingdom i'm gonna keep sending rockets until i see the other side of their base fancier this was not the end for king harvest but a new era has started on village warfare foreign welcome to day three of village warfare we made sulfur a 3x gather rate today to encourage more people to raid that way critters on the server could get more rating footage and raid defense content but i got a discord call from my friend koala who's a lord and harvest's kingdom and i discovered a horrible truth of king harvest he declared martial law on the village and now he's just evicted all the villagers from the island what so there's no there's no village anymore it's just like the king the lords and the knights there's no villagers god he is totally abandoned his village you need to talk to harvest has changed all right i'm gonna go load on the server right now then harvest had gone rogue harvest his knights and his lords raided every villager in the kingdom and kicked him off the island all right it was a massive uprising in the kingdom the villagers tried fighting together the harvest and his men were too powerful is zoo happens open the up fancy orb so harvest this is how democracy ends huh i've heard what you've been doing all day no this is how democracy begins this is how democracy begins fancy you can see we're all equal now we're all in one group we just got finished reading about 10 different villagers they're all gone they're all off the island we're one solid rust group now fancy so instead of being a leader you go around and raid all the people that were there on day one to support and build a community you've you've treated all those people with respect in the first two days but now you just throw them away like they're pieces of garbage harvest i i allowed them to leave i gave them a grace period they were allowed to leave the the island i did we didn't shoot at them we didn't kill them anyone who wanted to leave left and anyone who wanted to stay they had been raided conrad i see you up there do you support this conrad cause i know you we spent a lot of times together farming conrad i must support my king this is for the the greater good killer you were here when it was just the three of us after that speech i gave and this is and you you support this too killer yeah um i do we bought that water protect the villagers and they turned on us i i just don't even know what to say man i i'm really speechless but goodbye friends thank you meanwhile the hashtag clan was thriving at the top of the server anyone that stepped near their territory was immediately raided they had all the explosives they were the richest on the server and together they rated village after village around the map just a bit closer it was night time on day three of village warfare and after an entire day of raiding the hashtag clan was set on one final target harvest's kingdom harvest led a massive attack on the hashtag clan and now it was hashtags turn to attack harvest if harvest's kingdom lost this raid the event would truly be over all right listen up everybody some of you have been here for the beef some of you haven't but you know what we all have in common we hate harvesters we hate speaking of big dicks this guy thought he had a giant one when he came over to our land our sulfur quarry in our backyard that maybe we could get guest codes on it we're gonna take everything he has and we've brought the best in the business in order to do that we gathered here today to make a statement this raid is not about the winning or the losing this is a brotherhood the hashtag clan told harvest they'd be coming and harvest gave them raiders respect in return which means harvest would allow the hashtag clan to build a rape base and as soon as the first explosive goes off the battle starts home it was clear right off the bat that the hashtag clan knew what they were doing utilizing smoke grenades and using high walls to create a formation that would be impossible for harvest's men to shoot at everybody the only thing separating the hashtag clan from that main base was the kingdom walk but soon enough the hashtag clan had control of it now you would think harvest would be under severe pressure during this raid but he had a plan that night and that plan was about to go into effect are you in position we're in position to move in initiate it will be done thank you foreign was using the kingdom mall against harvest that wall was a blessing and a curse for harvest this entire event that wall was used to keep villagers away from the main base but now it's the very reason their base is being destroyed right now need to buy out the hashtag clan space the rating squad was getting deeper and deeper this was a race while harvest was being raided by the hashtag clan harvest hired another village to raid hashtag clan space while they weren't home both of the strongest teams on the server were now being rated at the same time #clay discovered this as other people on the server were pointing it out in the chat and the hashtag clay members started losing momentum is not getting rated right now it doesn't matter okay that's weird but that's something rainbows is anybody able to fly back from base we have minis the hashtag claim lost the raid and lost their base in the same hour after defending their kingdom against the hashtag clan and removing them from the server at the same time harvest and his men celebrated in the throne room but do you remember what was said earlier in this video but if anything in my plan falls apart or my final guide to pull this off i could see just if you're here still not only did you fight bravely for your lovely king harvest we managed to defeat our biggest enemy on the i would like to personally thank king harvest not only has he shown me how to be such a great king you have also shown me what not to do as a king it was about to happen the biggest betrayal rust has ever seen king harvest i over you for quite some time now and i don't believe you are fit to be any sort of king i also have access to all of the inside pirates and maybe during a meeting when all the villagers are there i can clear off and have the turrets wipe them out what i've done the most i have a plot twist for all of you it's actually me me a hoe beautiful it was perfection mimeo had stuck to his word and assassinated the king you you can tell this to dust you can tell us to his entire group we'll be back we'll be back as long as the nodes are still there as long as there's still people in my kingdom i'm gonna keep sending rockets until i see the other side of their base fancy orb the hashtag clan was officially removed from this event the hashtag clan played dirty by stream sniping and changing their names when they defended a raid so harvest also decided to play dirty by orchestrating a blindside attack this story wasn't about a hero versus a villain this story is about two villains clashing against each other both sides played unethical strategies to win this war but the kingdom ended up on top but this was only one of hundreds of stories that took place during this event and if you don't believe me you can ask these creators i've successfully infiltrated the biggest thing with the largest creator run events that he would be hosting a playlist this was an event ran by the community for the community so thank you to everyone who played during this event follow me on twitter to stay updated for the next four day live server event that i'm gonna be hosting this summer and if you want to play in the same private content server you saw in this video join the iep in the description,2023-05-24T15:00:26Z
DJYT6n-Li4k,How I Outsmarted 39 YouTubers in a Rust Tournament,2132433,39444,1105,0 days 00:26:26,there are 39 content creators in this tournament who are insane at pvp and then there's me but i'm gonna show you how i'm gonna outsmart every single one of them a few weeks ago i was invited to an ultra hardcore tournament held by a group called ot we have gathered 50 of rust's best content creators to make them face off against each other in our new uhc game mode now in this tournament there's tons of pvp sweaty chad youtubers and streamers who are expecting to beat me but i have one secret advantage that no one knows about now weeks before this tournament went down ot needed play testers to make sure the game mode works properly well a ton of my friends and close community members were invited to become playtesters and they were able to sneak me valuable information to help me win this tournament and it's the one advantage i have over these sweaty chads so a week before the tournament started i spoke to a good friend of mine one who is the very first winner of this uhc game mode soon we're gonna be put into a tournament full of chad's sweaty pvps people who have 10 000 plus hours some something's getting their twenty thousand dollars okay they need to see grass alright so the first thing need to know is every monument except for like the lighthouse has an elite crate spawn now what just informed me if i wanted a good gun i would need to go to a monument that has an elite crate spawn but the only monument that doesn't have elite crate spawn is the lighthouse and then it hit me everyone's gonna be going for like the tier three and tier two areas for elite crates do you think i could go to lighthouse since no one would go there would that work and also give me a second about that every single person in this tournament will be so focused on the bigger monuments with the good loot but if i go to the worst monument in this game i shouldn't run into anyone because no one is weird enough to camp lighthouse since there's no good loot so wubb secretly sent me the map and on the map there's three lighthouses the ones on the top of the map and the left of the map are the bad lighthouses because they're near launch site military tunnels and water treatment which increases the chances of me being near a pvp chat but the lighthouse on the right isn't a completely tier one area where no pvp would want to go you got this i actually don't have a mouse pads that'd be great but all right sounds good man i have to get lucky on my spawn and pray i spawn near the right lighthouse because in this game mode you only have three lives until you're limited so if i kill my player model for a new spawn point that would take away one of my three lives so pretty much whatever spawn point i get i have to commit to coconut friend oh it started oh please tell me i'm please tell me okay we're near the lighthouse we can run to the lighthouse all right we're going we got insanely lucky and spawned close enough where i could run to the lighthouse we wanted okay we got the lighthouse that we wanted we wanted the tier one lighthouse down at the bottom and that can get farmed up i can get stuff i can make it to the end because i'm going to that arena that center arena i'm going to make it that arena we're gonna get to that arena baby now that giant dome ahead is the final arena there's three stages to this tournament the grace period where pvp is disabled and everyone has time to farm build and get weapons then the pvp phase which lasts one hour and you could be eliminated from this tournament if you lose all your three lives but if you survive all that you enter the third stage which is the final arena where it's a final deathmatch hunger game style with the border slowly closing into the center but first we need to get to lighthouse i i highly doubt anyone will get to lighthouse what are the chances anyone would want to go to lighthouse now this tournament is called uhc which stands for ultra hardcore the reason why it's hardcore is because there's no farming like it's actually disabled so the only one way to get guns and armor and other items is through barrels and crates then you can get resources by recycling those items to build a base so that's why it's so crucial to have lighthouse to myself because not only do i get barrels and mid-tier crates to myself i also get my very own recycler there she is the lighthouse i hope no one's here man i hope no one's here no one would be weird enough to go here right no no one would even have that in their mind oh my god no one's here we got the crates at the bottom this could be huge guys no way this is gonna work oh yes we do it's blocked off as i arrive to lighthouse there wasn't a single person insight which meant my plan was working so far while everyone was going for the good monuments with elite crates i was hidden away on my own lighthouse look at that we already got the forest raider kilt look at that boom so we know how we can get our armor i just still don't know how i'm gonna get a gun now i'm able to get armor easily from these barrels but the only issue as mentioned earlier is lighthouse is the only monument on this map that doesn't spawn elite crates with guns while everyone on the map is getting high tier military weapons i'm getting melee weapons so that's why i talked to another good friend of mine who is a play tester for this event i'm actually going to be living at lighthouse what do you think about that it's not a bad idea as long as no one loves lighthouse nova leak crates are going to spawn their military crates where would i be able to get a gun there's a dome in the middle where you can buy rifle bodies and stuff okay so i have to run all the way through the middle to get a like an smg body or something or a rifle body yeah all right am i you think i could do this best yeah so according to my friend bets there are vending machines at the dome in the middle where i can buy a rifle and smg bodies to craft a gun so i needed to run over and buy a gun because in 15 minutes the grace period would end and pvp would be enabled and i'd be stuck with melee weapons but before i did that i heard a noise outside of lighthouse oh oh no no no no someone's here someone came to lighthouse on the boat and my secret spot was compromised there could be a pvp chat down there about to catch me hiding at lighthouse and ruin this whole plan someone's here our spot has been compromised yo who's there that's fancy who is this black oh my god black thank god it's you man i was scared someone was coming up on the bow and i'm like oh my god it's gonna be one of those chads but i'm so glad to hear it's you man how you doing thank god the person who pulled up ballet house was a good friend of mine mr flack black has been in many videos of mine and we even did an interview podcast on his channel so i was relieved to discover it was him just just us i'm good i'm good i'm excited god we're almost out of time though yeah i know i know i i gotta quickly run to the to the dome i'm about to leave here in a second but i need to buy something but yeah what you doing here man please don't tell me it's gonna stay i don't wanna have to cut black i decided to farm ocean oh nice that's smart i'm gonna be back later uh i gotta go to uh the dome real quick but i'll see you around good luck brother yeah if i don't see you when i'm back uh good luck now is the perfect time to leave lighthouse to go buy a weapon because i didn't want flack knowing i was going to camp at lighthouse the more people that know i'm at lighthouse could potentially destroy the plan god flack i'm sorry i love you but i really hope you're not there when i get back because uh i don't want to have to kill you flaxa please it was a peaceful run to dome but soon i'd be interrupted yet again yeah fancy what's up man oh hello hello tacular how are you doing i'm just uh scanning the area real quick i don't notice that you're teaming up with anybody the host of this event was another youtuber named tacular who was streaming this event to 700 viewers on twitch and it came into my voice call for an interview but one thing about tacular is he is one of the best pv peers in this game so it's the perfect opportunity to ask him for advice since you're a pvp god you know and i need your recommendation uh what smg should i make here should i go for a thompson or like an mp5 what do you think i should go for here as someone who doesn't pvp a lot don't even bother with the mp5 that shit's so 2008 that's just rubbish okay just get that out of your mod you want to try and get a thompson okay okay thompson is the option here that's my best chance yeah seriously your best chance i'm going to buy a thompson thank you so much tequila i appreciate your input no worries fancy like honestly i think you're probably one of the smarter ones in this event now that i think about it these guys they're playing checkers but you're out here you're playing chess do you really mean that tech do you really mean that i mean it i mean it i mean it i think i think you got a good chance here seriously all right there we go we got our smg body we're gonna make a thompson with this now we go back to lighthouse all right sweet home now let's just hope mr flack isn't here or anyone else or anyone else honestly i'll take mr flack over everyone else though black are you home it looked like mr flack had disappeared so we had lighthouse to ourselves again but it was minutes away before the grace period ends and the chad pvps we're gonna start hunting okay i see these wooden barricades keep spawning which could be good it could alert us if someone's coming through but one advantage i had at camping at lighthouse is that there are two wooden barricades blocking the entrances so players have to destroy it if they want to enter so if anyone sneaks up to my lighthouse and i don't realize it i'm completely safe because all i have to do is use my ears if someone starts breaking the barricade to enter the lighthouse i know someone is here and it gives me time to hide alright ice cold thompson blue for fancy orb okay this might be good it was the final seconds of the grace period and pvp was gonna be enabled for the entire server while every content creator went for a high tier monuments built bases and were much scarier than i was i was the only weirdo living in a tier 1 monument all right pvp is enabled now we watch people die oh my god look at the chat people are actually dying the plan was in full motion it stopped already nerd i wish well the entire server was fighting each other and losing their lives out in the dangerous areas of the map i was comfortably sitting at lighthouse with my toes out watching it unfold it was beautiful it was perfection my plan was working while everyone's out there killing each other i'm just gonna chill here that is how you outplay the chads oh my god what am i doing what am i doing dude but after 12 minutes of camping lighthouse during the pvp phase i had my first visitor oh there's someone in there don't kill me i got one life someone's down there hello up there hello you're scaring me man i got one life i can't be i can't be dying here bro what's your name what's your name green green you're sus bro you're sus listen man how about that i'll leave all right wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on do you have intel for me like any intel how what happened with your with your lives i died to practice and i died at uh satellite dish to i don't remember but it might have been deathwing good but i don't remember all right uh here do you want uh here you can have this i'm so i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry green i'm so sorry i'm about oh i'm an evil man yes i know i killed an innocent man and eliminated his last life from this competition and i was filled with guilt i have to do whatever it takes to defend my lighthouse to make sure no one snitches my plan or spreads the word i'm camping here was it wrong yes but as one last person i have to worry about when the pvp stage is over and all the final contestants are brought to the final arena can't believe i've done this i can't believe i've done that i had to i had to guys all right i did not want to kill him okay but i realized these people are my competitors i need to do what i have to do to get to the end all right after that i realized lighthouse is slowly consuming me and making me do things i wouldn't normally do this place was making me go crazy to do that i have blood on my hands is that someone 's here someone's here so someone is here what the what is going on now i know i'm going crazy at lighthouse but items were dropping in front of me it's trolling me right now i mean it's it's lost wait lost you could pick this up wait wait wait loss how can you interact with the stuff it was a good friend of mine and fellow youtuber lost lost was eliminated from this challenge and lost his three lives but what i discovered is when you're eliminated you can still spectate and when spectating you can still interact with items and drop or pick them up from the ground so i quite literally had an angel over my shoulders protecting me in this tournament plus lost wait do i have an angel speaking to me drop something to me if you're listening lost drop something to me a gear in front of my toes oh my god he is here holy thank you oh thank you oh my god this is amazing toss one crude oil if there's anyone like a few grids near me okay all right toss two if there is not let's go let's go let's go okay okay now i realize that i'm practically talking to a ghost here and if anyone else saw this they think i'm crazy talking to myself check out fancy fancy did say he was going to the lighthouse duh he is just doing it better than at least half the people who the chucking him what the is he talking to who the is he talking to this guy's delusional mate there is nobody around stop talking to yourself fancy who the is he talking to i'm so confused this guy's talking to himself there's nobody around him it's a next level delusion great in frodo 700 live viewers i look delusional talking to myself and i found out pretty quickly because one of my friends were watching it live and she clipped it yo i think tacular is watching us dude last how could you set me up like this oh you're so cute but it wasn't long until i'd get another lighthouse visitor i heard a footstep someone's here someone is here this is not good foreign listen man i have a family to feed all right i can't believe you would do this to me listen man just look away just please turn around so this is easy for me all right just please everybody what the no no no no no no no i now had the blood of two innocent men on my hands i realized by living in a tier one area on the map the people who died and are starting fresh will go to lighthouse since it's the easiest monument to get a new start but every single person who tries to do that runs into mr fancy word is it ethical to do this not at all but it does make it easier for the final death match in the dome later in this video oh my god don't open the door stop stop doing it lost lost stop doing that i i'm serious stop you're actually tweaking me out dude i really didn't want to have to do that i also discovered that lost can also interact with doors which is absolutely crazy ot who's hosting the tournament probably doesn't even realize this but it's something that could be severely exploited and he confirmed it with a note he dropped to me with 30 minutes left before the final death match i realized i'm severely under geared all the other chads who have tier 3 weapons and armor are going to destroy me especially since i'm not good at pvp well that's why another play tester this week gave me some interesting advice so you are in uhc play tester is that correct yeah i'm uh pretty much the pro what can i say say so i know how i can survive the pvp stage but i don't know what i'm gonna do when i get in that arena you know i'm not good at pvp but you've been in that arena how can i survive it you gotta just book it for the center man you gotta secure that you're gonna get something down if i run out to the middle that's a suicide mission get something down get some cover down get anything just secure that point because it's all gonna end there man well i'm really trusted in you here man got you my man koala told me the best thing i can do is run for the center and build the base everyone will spawn on the outside and their first instinct will be killing the person that's next to them but if i can slip out from the crowd and sneak my way into the middle of the arena and build a base eventually the zone will end up in the middle and by the time it gets to the middle 90 of the arena should be dead it's risky and i have no idea if running to the center right at the beginning will work but it's the best thing i've got going for me we have 16 minutes until we get into the middle but as i was prepping my final minutes before the arena a familiar voice joined me again what's what's going on man oh my god once you scare the out of me tackle listen man i i'm a guilty man okay i've done a lot of things secular i did hear you before talking to yourself and i was very confused what's going on lighthouse makes you go crazy how is the conscious feeling because from what i see you're overwhelmed with guilt is that something you're willing to live with for the rest of your life spectacular whatever i have to do to bring this w home and represent team fancier i will do it okay there was two people all right two people that spawned near this lighthouse and i i had to put them down tacular all right i know i know i had to put them down i need to get to the end tacular i told you i was going to you said i was smart you were hyping me up this is your fault you made me kill those guys listen here how about you shut your mouth you're losing it you're losing it this lighthouse is doing things to your brain it's not a chemical get it together man you've got 11 minutes to the last zone slap yourself in the face jump in the water near you if you have to okay you need to get it together man you're losing it you are going to shred through every in that time you hear me thank you no worries good luck man all right he's lost fancies that guy's he's gone i don't know what's going on but he's mentally checked out play this really dirty yeah i think we need to you might be wondering why am i wasting my valuable resources for a sofa well not only did i speak to play testers for this tournament this week i spoke to one of the smartest trap basers in this game for sneaky advice to help me in the arena all right caseyville i'm going against a bunch of chads in a tournament soon and i suck at pvp do you know any sneaky tactics i could use to my advantage or anything like that do you know about the uh the couch trick so let me let me build it first okay this is how we do it now one thing about casey mill is he is extremely smart and i had no idea what he was building but he knows something here that i don't and if we have it as a two by two there we go all right so this hands down is the most broken strat that you could possibly do in the game right now you put the couch right there place those and now come sit down on this couch oh i can see god this is great i'm gonna do this in your honor all right i will say one thing though because it is an exploit so you got to be kind of careful i am scared mr flack i'm going with your hammer this is for you since i saw you at lighthouse earlier it was the final minutes of the pvp stage before all the survivors would be teleported in the dome arena i said my final goodbye to the lighthouse well this is it lighthouse i appreciate all the memories we had we were able to kill two people together we met demons we met angels who communicated to us overall i wouldn't say we did too bad we got a smg we got full kitted together and we are ready for the arena and i do not regret this at all so i appreciate you lighthouse someone's here what i'm fancy are you shooting at me right now with pvp's disabled wait why is pvp disabled why is pvp disabled look at the top right and we're getting teleported you scared me man you should take it to my luck now that pvp is disabled would you like to talk about it like what happened earlier address the elephant in the room listen bro you're scaring me earlier and i scared you what what are you just gonna charge at someone with that bro like look at all the chads in there with aks and both these and you think you really think you're staying a chance cup do you really think you stand one i don't even say no tits and i know that but my shirt i'm only relying on my strategy good luck up here it is the arena we're going for the we're going right for the center i was teleported into the arena and this was the moment all 23 survivors in this dome were ready to battle this out running to the center may be a suicide mission but the final play tester i spoke to this week gave me great advice all right another play tester told me i should run out to the middle and it seems like a suicide mission i don't know what i'm gonna do but how do i get to the middle you always want to have high walls on you if you get shot at if you need to build if you need to block anyone you always want to be careful people are going to be trying to make bases they're going to be trying to bake huge towers you're telling me people are going to be building bases in the arena yes 100 probably want to wear as much camo as possible there's a lot of trees there's a decent amount of rocks i'm gonna bring this home thank you so much it'll work man throughout the grace period and pvp stage i was crafting high wood walls for cover and making a camouflage kit to help me run towards the middle there's tons of trees grass and rocks that'll help me sneak through the middle as well if i can get to that center i'm booking it to that center the great run towards the center and there i was running to the center praying that a single person will see me out in the open now how did i end up in a dome arena with some of the best pvps in this game i still have no clue but just for a second there as my adrenaline was rushing i thought to myself i could win this slap yourself you need to get together man you're losing it i'm going to shred okay we made it oh my god let's do this and now we build i found a spot that was close enough to the middle and i got my base down but i didn't have enough resources to upgrade the roof so it was a bit risky this is so bad i don't even have enough resources so according to kc mode i should be able to sit in this and i do oh my god okay i'm in through the door right now i'm invisible i think i set up the couch trick so if anyone walked outside my base i could kill them with this exploit but i heavily underestimated why casey mo told me earlier it is an exploit so you got to be kind of careful what yo chill chill don't do this please yo whoever's doing this why eliminated players were now closing and opening my door because as we learned earlier this is one of the many things that they can still do this leaves me at a severe disadvantage because now outside players were interacting and opening my door and if anyone sees or hears this they could easily kill me the people realized i could actually do this and they didn't want to see me win but my angel from earlier lost saw this unfair treatment of people opening my doors and he tossed me something extremely useful what oh my god i just got a c4 thank you lost thank you other craters were calling this out in the chat but they didn't realize that people were with me my other creator friends were starting to drop me notes helping me with advice i know i know i'm out of resources even stoned to upgrade my unfinished roof yes please drop the stone please please please please please please yes let's go let's go and even mushrooms so i could heal my close friends in this event had my back helping me fight against the people trying to get me killed but my ops were one step ahead of me because my angel lost who was there from the beginning was banned from the server no lost got banned they don't want to see me win now i just had to wait wait for everyone to die as the border gets smaller and smaller one at a time watching crater after creator die in the chat laughs the only issue was i didn't exactly calculate the middle of the arena and i was slightly off which means eventually i need to leave my base when the border gets to me another person eliminated oh my cover we're actually doing it we're actually doing it i hear someone outside my base someone is outside my base right now oh my god no way i'm top five we're top five i had made it to the final four but the border was now at my base and i had to start moving all right here we go oh my god i'm not going over to that bolti because that is where albin is yep my heart is pounding right now yeah yeah he's got it he's got it he's gone now right here it looks like i should see yexim in my pov but a hemp plant was blocking my vision unfortunately i was eliminated and for those who weren't curious who won it was another creator named alvin i can't believe now you might be curious why did i make this video if i lost well it's because i didn't see it as a loss i was actually really happy making it fourth place no one was expecting me fans who are but a non-pv peer to get to final four the fact that i out survived so many people using these goofy strategies and actually worked fulfilled me alone and it just goes to show sometimes you don't need to be the best pvp to win sometime so to green and gup i'm so sorry for killing you earlier and said my habibi's lost confusion in harvest i appreciate you boys having my back in the arena and who knows maybe there's gonna be another rust tournament in the future but if there's a creator listening right now you better not go to lighthouse yeah oh ,2023-04-02T15:30:02Z
K5ZVIzOJVSc,Can 100 Players Survive a Flooding Rust Server?,848375,16388,466,0 days 00:14:09,there are 100 players on the server and the water will rise until the map is completely flooded but when the water is high enough a massive cargo ship will arrive and the only way to escape the server is by leaving on this boat everyone will be fighting to the death for a spot towards their freedom but the players have time to build and prepare before the map is flooded so let's see how the players will react during this experiment server start the flooding it's at a slow pace so you guys have nothing to worry about you guys have time but let's go around and see what you guys have been up to now it wasn't long after this until i noticed communities were starting to form oh my god there's like a community here what you guys doing who is the leader of this place well where's swishy come on come on up wishy come on up over here you're a disgusting man this is wishy now throughout this video we'll run into different characters but wishy here would be someone that starts some trouble fancy you're disgusting why what do you mean what did i do you guys are you guys are kicking me out why are you guys prioritizing beds over me you guys are gonna regret that now it was clear that this church was built for one thing and one thing only to praise best a beloved character you've seen on my channel in the past but for some reason they were extremely hostile and wanted nothing to do with me come on at this point in the event water was taking over the map and soon roads and monuments would be unavailable to the players but even though all players knew the water was rising some players wanted to enjoy the lands while i was still here that mac hello yo fancy or nice fortnite fortnite is supported before it is actually a porter for wow and look over there can you guys both 1v1 real quick on the fortnite over here i want to see this okay when i shoot my m2 in the air you guys will start are you guys ready three two one oh my god i'm actually watching what am i watching dude oh my god oh my god you lost with the high ground bro all right ggs guys it was fun watching trevi says fancy tp for gulp gold what does that mean it's a gold fish god one of the players i found was someone named trevi now throughout this event i needed to build my team of avengers because as mentioned previously when the water covers the entire map a massive cargo ship will arrive the only way to win this event is by escaping on this boat so i needed to build up my dream team and help them escape so i wanted to test traffic's loyalty to see if he'd be a good fit for my team i got a mission for you okay go down there and give them the gulp gold go go go go go go go go go oh wait wait try to take this take this take this you need some of these wait wait wait wait wait wait we got one more land it go traffic go go my friend's coming in all right go leave leave go trappy now now trappy no no trevor oh you got it traffic let's go i think it's safe to say that trevi deserves to be the first member of my team now as the water was rising most people decided to build the tallest towers possible holy some of you guys are building tall ass buildings here so i wanted to give one person a proposition salty isn't it beautiful up here it's such a beautiful view you know it would it would really hurt if you fell off the tower right oh yeah it would yeah would do you think it'd be worth it for ruskin you know if i said jump off the tower and i'd give you a ruskin would you do it yes you know what to do soldier i salute you goodbye so i met up with my admin bralo to give him a task this is your fit brolo this is what you're wearing bro yeah listen umbrella i need you to establish the navy now what i mean by that is i need you to go around on a rib pick them up on the boat and establish a navy okay the navy is gonna take over the cargo are you down for this brolo i'm

different task you are gonna be the air force club so you're gonna go around on a shuna spawn scrappies and minnie i'm testing which admin will be able to do it better will it be the navy or will it be the air force all right go ahead go go go oh my god wait it's the navy it's the navy oh yeah is that you come over here come over here all right i just talked to gloom in here and what you don't know yet is you guys are enemies and i'm putting you guys against each other you're gonna be taking it with your navy bralo but glooming is the air force and evil also be going for the cargo now that two armies were forming on the server let's see what the other players are up to oh my god you guys have like a sky village this is so cool man oh my god you have a pogo stick yeah jump around let me see let me see oh my god oh my god you're gonna do it yo he's doing the bike oh my god so you guys you guys are really good friends correct yeah yeah i'd say so last person standing will win a bunch of ruskins let's see if you guys will truly thank you all right are you guys are truly friends all right i respect that this is a good community oh my god i didn't realize how crazy the map is flooding now there's a lot of things on the server you guys will not have access to anymore like uh let's see mining outposts what else is underwater to abandoned military base wait a second fact or cap do you guys think that the mlrs will still shoot even though it's underwater what are we thinking i've never shot an mlrs underwater who wants to shoot it all right i see wicked in the chat actually we need to get traffic too this is gonna be a duo mission now listen guys we need to strategically plan where we're gonna hit the village the church oh i agree good thinking trevi the people that kicked us out of the church earlier i'll be right back let me check where it is real quick i'll be right back okay perfect ly where their base is you cannot miss it do you have the target is it or is it ready yeah it's targeted three two one fire boy it's back the water will still shoot it oh nice we destroyed the building yeah yeah it was me it was me now that i've taken care of what she

sunny you have to whisper this okay do you want to cause some trouble ben shapiro this is ben shapiro and del for real now i wanted to put them up to the test to see if they are worthy of joining team fancy all right you guys both want to cause some trouble i want them to cause trouble let me give you guys some some tools yeah yeah you see where this is going do you guys see that like skye kingdom over there i'm gonna gather them in the middle when you hear me in the discord i'll say pog pog pog that means start shooting and sniping them and they will not know because you guys are silencers yo

mission okay fancy what did we do to you huh good job boys good job you guys did good you guys got so many kills good job keep going boys after that successful mission ben and dell are the newest recruits of team fancy something that was brought up earlier oh is that is that traffic oh traffic you're just in time i'm introducing the pogo stick man hey give me all your money those who don't know there's a pogo stick on the server watch out don't don't stand up dude don't stand under it what is this oh my god i did the flip okay okay okay i need to get out of this all right whoa i think it's safe to say that oscar here would make a great bodyguard for team fancy give us your money too high give me a gold cup on the air traffic all right oscar let's see you yo someone made a perfectly placed circle of sleeping bags and it kind of looks like a circle from my last to leave circle videos who wants to do a little mini less to leave the circle challenge video last person leave gets like a skin congratulations the three of you aren't the last to leave circle video no killing each other no hitting each other but if someone comes and kills you guys that's okay that counts so they're in top of five seven in the middle the three contestants quickly built themselves into a base to avoid side players killing them oh it's so small but we'll check back on them later meanwhile the whole map was nearly flooded and the cargo ship was coming very soon but the navy was being sabotaged and had to resort to an underwater headquarters how's the navy going we're killing it man we we're living in the water right now on the other hand the air force was thriving on the server oh my god there's a lot more people in the air force you're a little bit more popular over here man go ahead and tell me a little bit about the air force uh we're in blue and we have helicopters and we're better than the navy it seemed like more people wanted to fly rather than swim so gloomin had a major advantage over bralo and while armies were building in the background my team is causing chaos in the last bit of land that was left how are my snipers doing how many kills have you guys look on the roof man oh my god this one oh my god get him get him get him get him nice nice good guys you're the best snipers in the game oh my god i just realized that there's very little lands left no way someone would be at dome right now oh oh wow there is no what are you guys doing at dome here hello we're gonna play some music for your fancy speaking of editor a4 editors and whoever the lucky one is is gonna have a hard time here in a second i like to test my editors every once in a while and give them something hard like for example i'm subtitling my words right now and it's in the right never mind editor cut that out anyways who wants to help me test my editor yeah i'm gonna choose you trevor you're perfect for this all right so traffic whatever you say my editor will do for example

control right now go ahead how many more explosions like three more like boom boom boom one last final image to put on the screen travi what do you want them to put on the screen right now it can be anything subscribe to fancy oh good traffic good they're gonna hate me man the map was completely flooded in a couple minutes the cargo was entering the server so i gathered my team and gave them the final speech before the battle guys the cargo is arriving okay you guys are the dream team i've been building up this event okay give me a gluck cluck travis oscar oscar give me a give me your money

last guy on their dell died too now during all this chaos i had completely forgotten about the last elite circle challenge from earlier and because the water was rising the contestants had to build up while staying inside the circle to avoid being eliminated that is until a heli came by and killed all the contestants except for penneth who is the winner of the circle it looked like the air force had controlled the cargo and were able to keep the navy away but as i came back from the circle challenge the fight wasn't over yet as part of the navy or the air force air force is coming boys oh my god the air force has arrived the air force is on the cargo oh we got more air force on the cargo oh my god they're coming back with more holy wait the air force took cargo back congratulations if you made it onto the cargo the water is going back to zero and you guys are all gonna float to the ground here we go boom oh my god,2023-03-06T19:00:07Z

admin control and i can do anything in my admin abilities to kill these players i could turn myself into a helicopter with deadly missiles i could send drone strikes and wipe out entire bases and other crazy ways i can admin abuse the players what the twist is everyone only has one life so if a player dies they're kicked and eliminated from the server and now you have 10 000 hp but i'm not allowed to heal so if they kill me they can win let's see if 200 players can defeat one admin abuser all right everyone go go go go go go you have 30 minutes to go the 200 players have 30 minutes to farm build bases and prepare for the hunt there's two strategies that players can do they can hide and stay sneaky until the time runs out to survive or they can band together and fight against me gloomin are you ready to get this thing started i am indeed ready this is glooming and he's my right hand man today now globa can't kill players but he can help me in other ways like spotting out

the last admin abuse video when there's a big base and we flew on top of the roof yeah that's what we're gonna do here okay and the last admin abuse video when there was a big base with tons of players gloomin and i used a drop-off tactic where i activated a freezeability on the thanos gauntlet so we're gonna do the same strategy but with the force choker all right let's go here we go boys here we go sorry boys it was a good run but it ends here if you're in this g4 area i would leave now while you can do not try to fight it because i will find you nah you're not going anywhere get me

forming a safety area called the temple this is a place where all survivors were meeting up to build an army led by braulo to see that island right there you're gonna go over there and go to the temple do you need a place to hide i'm building something now look if things go south it's an n3 it's an island and n3 yo listen listen up boys if you guys want i can't yeah oh my jesus you guys have

lied to me about food after i saved you you're really gonna do that to me man look out into the ocean isn't it beautiful it's so beautiful don't appreciate when people lie to me okay drove past an island it's actually really close we suspect this might be where bralo's location is i'm assuming he's gonna try to gather up an army like he always does in my videos but i need to build an army of my own so would you guys be willing to join the dark side let me speed it out speak with him all right he has a lightsaber off a baseball bat we join him there's no choice here i realized i would need a team to fight against brolo and his army and later in this event i would gather an army of my own for an epic battle on his island waffler lived wait waffler did he survive the fall oh my god i don't see his body he stood up no way he stood up you can basically call me kratos or some because i'm alive now we continue our search i don't think that'll be them but i've been having a fight already oh

killed my men all right i was recruiting then that shows are more powerful than them do you committee instead they were good enough for you i'm better you want to be my new apprentice yum far oh i love it you are now on my team put your new kit on you proved you're more dominant yes my lord now after this i went around the entire server recruiting players to my team so i could attack barlow's temple so far in the lightsaber i've been able to force pole force push forced choke and the final ability was forced meteors for one evil plan i had was to trap the most beloved character in my channel best everyone loves bazemite videos but if i teleported him to a cage the entire server would go berserk trying to find him and this would be the plan to bait out players so i could kill them hey best i teleport fox hello how you doing hey everyone on the server you guys love baz well i have teleported him into a jail cell in five minutes i'm going to kill baz and if no one comes to rescue him well he's just gonna be eliminated wallace yes i'm willing to switch to the dark side to live that's that's what i wanted to hear about is that is that so bad baz has joined the dark side boys i then went to have a peek at bralo's temple to see how powerful they were for this war oh my god there's so many of them what the is brolo doing dude all right i actually don't know what to do here man this is now this made me realize i needed a much larger army so i asked around the map for big groups of people i could recruit on my team and people were saying there's a big base in the snow so i knew we needed to recruit these players oh my god all right okay back out back i'm coming back out back up 813 do you hear me i'm here to negotiate i'm not gonna kill you the whole fire i say i'm coming out with no weapons rightfully so this group didn't trust me but i was trying to be patient and show them that i meant no harm yeah negotiation yeah all right here we go brawler is building an empire in m3 okay all right all right i try to warn you i really did i wanted to be nice k-13 i really wanted to be nice i really just wanted to be nice you're gonna help me defeat bralo this is gonna be great but you didn't want that so this is what you get really sucks man this really sucks it didn't have to be like this voice it didn't have to be like this bralo's men were loyal to him and no matter what held their ground against me i was actually desperate at this point and i had no choice but to publicly announce my plans and open draft to anyone who wants to join the dark side to anyone on the server right now if you would like to join the dark side and join my team go to the spawn and i i promise you this is not a trap i will invite you to my team and we will march together to take out brawlow this is this is me being desperate right now okay i am not this is what how you know it's not a scam i am desperate i don't have enough people to fight brawlow and the plan worked perfectly all the survivors around the map who didn't join brolo's temple decided to join me in this war and support the movement of the dark side i was building an army and i now had soldiers i could march with to the temple so my entire team loaded into the choppers and it was time to attack bralo's temple all right my team load up in the choppers let's go we're going to the temple right now everyone let's go all right everyone up everyone out bro hello hope you're ready this party is over man i need to push up since i have more help stay here with the soldiers until i say push all right foreign everything could have been so great brother look what you did look around get this each other man and so many people have to die because of it and that's the result of your own actions fancy well if that's the case more people are about to die start pushing the bridge let's finish all right it's over fancy i have the high ground ,2023-02-16T19:00:11Z
R8JnUTSP9FQ,Rust Last to Leave Island Keeps ENTIRE Server (100 Players),1246527,24716,1689,0 days 00:32:14,the last person to leave this island in rust keeps the entire server i've gathered 100 players and everyone only has one life and if you die you're kicked from the server and we go until there's one person left but since we're on a tiny island teams will form politics will arise and many groups will betray each other but only one will win the island we started the event by gathering everyone in the meeting area the meeting area is a place that has shops for the economy trading windows in a place where islanders can just gather but it was time to welcome the islanders and get this started welcome everyone to fancy's island one of you will be winning this island and keeping the entire server if you were the last one standing now pvp is currently disabled for the next 45 minutes so everyone has time to farm and make their bases there are no rules on this island so you can form teams you can betray do whatever it takes to be the last person standing the island experiment begins now the islanders left the meeting area now have the entire island to explore and soon they discover more landmarks the first landmark people discovered was the plaza a way to farm and spend your scrap my two admins bralo and kiliman have stores where players can buy necessary items to survive women sells decorations while bralo sells food because on this island food is scarce there's only one river that produces food but it doesn't produce enough for 100 players but now that everyone was building their bases it's time to go around and meet the people of the island i plan on making a safe haven for players oh we got a hotel going oh my god oh my god what is this all right we are going to be making a community of of this what do you say you'd need most for this casino to get it going we would like to have like a small pen drive me to spinning wheel for you know and just a big sign to promote the casino all right i'll support that i'll support that this is america absolutely it is all right take this take these as well around the house islands i met players with strong ambitions to build safe havens hotels and i even ran into some youtubers who joined the event confusion how you doing man what are you doing here man yo yo it's i okay what's up i okay at the start a community was being formed and everyone was on the same page but it wasn't until jackson what are you doing here man are k destroyed some random dude's base man the exum here informed me that ot was also on the island now if you don't know who ot is they're the best clan in russ you've seen them on my channel before and they're known for their insane pvp skills well for their best members were on the islands and they were already causing trouble by destroying someone's base guys ot is probably the biggest threat on this island just keep that in mind etsy we're getting the safe haven down all right jesse come outside so is this where the safe haven's gonna go yeah sir this is an islander i met named jesse now jesse here pledged that he would establish a safe haven for all players on the island i plan on making a safe haven for players we want to get a good chunk of the island and just turn it into a place where players can go to be safe but what happens when ot comes in with all their guys what are you gonna do about that hold on now though i'm a pacifist at a heart those are on my list like the only way we take them out is if we work together you guys got a good thing going all right gather the safe haven gather more members to protect the safe haven and you charge together and defeat ot in this pass all right boys take 200 spread i support your cause let's go boys let's go communities all over the island were forming and so far everyone was friendly but once pvp would be enabled it would show the true side of some players another landmark on the island is the resource dome because the island is so small for 100 players everyone's competing to get resources but the resource dome is a guaranteed way to get the resources you need you have to buy a red key card at the meeting area for 200 scrap but the dome has crates food wood stones literally anything you could possibly need and look who's already here ot members i could already tell these guys were strictly business already utilizing the benefits of being inside the resource dome how do i get in hey can i get in another islander i ran into was bez hey what's happening best what's happening whoa whoa hey what'd you just call would you call pez whoa i called them hola you don't like beth oh he do you like him no take off your head let's see your hairline you guys have the same hairlines you guys are literally the same character models there was already beef on the island forming with baz and another kid because he called them a bad word this is one of the many rivalries that are to come baz versus evil beds we have another meeting mandatory meeting in five minutes it was time to gather up everyone at the meeting area again for an election because we needed a leader of the island but as i said in the first meeting these are mandatory and one person decided not to show up we have our first death here this man is refusing to go to the mandatory meeting speed bean i'm sorry man you're going to die can we get an f in the chat for speed bean all right everyone we are a society and every society has a leader everyone type in the chat one person you'd like to be the leader of the island bazen re-kid were the most voted in the chat now it's time to give their speeches on why everyone should vote for them because i is the leader um on the coolest um but then it was reek his turn to speak and no one was expecting this we joined together as one we can erect still towers of power around the island we will make these imperishable fortresses of pure penetration power are you with me it's safe to say that re-kid won the election and now he had a ton of power on the island thank you but baz was hurt after that first it was evil baz earlier calling him names and now he just lost the first election come here man come here okay you're right man how do you you doing all right i know you're having some issues with people it was first that ola guy and now it's re-kid look at the people here look at the people who stayed these are the loyal baz voters all right these people were the ones who voted for you and stayed with you best i do not give up do you understand yes do you understand buzz all right guys take care of baz okay you guys need to take care of us the people who stayed back for baz were jesse and the members of the safe haven these were the loyal people who stayed for baz even after the election but there's a few people who didn't like the newly elected leader reed kid and that was ot during re-kid speech they were the only ones typing l and muted in the chat while everyone was spamming w's and getting hyped up ot wanted to assassinate the leader re-kids look at this guy jesus guys what is your new leader doing what guys come on fancy the other jesse pikmin wants to destroy the safe haven i have another person on my list yeah he has it too big of a baby we're gonna hunker down oh my god a stash oh and i forgot to mention there's hidden stashes all around this island with secret loot like guns and resources this player just happened to find one of the stashers while we were talking you guys just randomly found the stash wow oh lies i need to talk no no you come here hola you come here you you come here why are you saying that about bass man what is baz doing huh he copied me he copied me listen man are you guys your squeakers all right you guys band together you're not supposed to be against each other okay oh my god i hope you brutally as i hope someone murders you olaf yep yep placing a bounty on ola if you kill him in the pvp stage i'll give you 200 scripts then the landmark on the island is the parkour area in the middle every now and then i'll sponder bradley crate with really good items and whoever completes the parkour first gets the crate but players could die to fall damage so they'd be risking their life to get this crate so i've placed a bradley crate on top of the parkour course first person to get it gets the bradley crate kill your dogs get the out of the way this is my crate this is my crate jackson stay back some i'll stay here to the people subscribe you're a little bit no way soon i'd realize characters were forming on this island the good people like jesse and baz the bad people like ot and evil bands but then you have the rats who play dirty like yaksa blocking off the parkour and harvest who cheated the parkour oh you think you're smart harvest what was that back there yeah yeah i'm fancy i am fancy come on i could just fly to the top but it was time to start the first pvp stage and it would be enabled until 10 of the island dies pvp is enabled good luck boys good luck all of a sudden the island went quiet and people stayed on their bases because no one wanted to die dude the island is so quiet now where'd everyone go man everyone's like quarantined right now meanwhile ot was utilizing the safety of the resource dome since the only way people could get in was through the red key card door foreign you guys cannot hurt each other anymore and we can come out of their shells we did lose 12 people during that pvp stage we lost one notable character they killed the casino owner no the casino owner died the casino was a short-lived dream as the owner was killed during the first pvp stage i talked to his neighbor and he informed me of the sad news i didn't come listen listen so basically i'll break down the doors let's just come in damn this place is gonna be good yeah i think it was that's actually sad basically a casino owner went ahead and closed the guy in here instead of just waiting it out he decided to kill them oh man that's sad man that kid had big hopes and dreams this is america and soon to come this would be the fate of many people on this island not everyone will be able to win and unfortunately every player you see in this video will experience the same tragedies after one player who makes it to the end a casino will long live forever hola how did you survive i placed that balancing on you and you still stayed alive i don't know you didn't kill your rival last night no no we we we made up we made up however in the chaos of the first purge we did lose one we made it great for him over here he's the one who had the custom i also learned in the last pvp stage jesse lost one of his members of the safe haven the person who accidentally found the stash from earlier oh he's the one that found the custom all right i've spawned another bradley crate at the top of the parkour and this one my god dude if you guys get this this is actually gonna be huge if you come with a mini i'm destroying you this time thank you thank your knees minis no no stop saying that okay one two three no way oh my god the jackson gets the cream oh my god the next pvp stage was enabled and this time ot was going around killing in fact their next door neighbors were annoying and taunting them but when pvp gets enabled you're dead how about that if you kill me i will be thoroughly surprised and well ot didn't take kindly of that guys we saw the sign with we're here to be friends to show some trust for each other and during the pvp first the only time that we can kill each other meanwhile youtubers i okay swales and sebike were teaming up and also proved to be a dominant threat to the island thank you did he get somebody oh that's okay that's okay that's right okay but me i nearly died he went into this place ping is not for me after that pvp stage 30 players in total have been eliminated all right pvp is disabled pvp is disabled in five minutes so everyone has to get to the meeting area it was time to have another meeting once again but i noticed another player didn't attend so i had to kill him all right guys can we get an f for jerry he did not show up to the meeting but there's a sadistic and evil reason why jerry didn't make it to the meeting it was because my community manager b george locked him in his basement so he couldn't make the meeting mandatory meeting at five minutes oh look get me out of this we're gonna leave jerry sorry jerry sorry jerry you're gonna have to die you have a good day there jerry all right up all right jerry i'm sorry you did not show up to the meeting you are dead oh my god man we held another election in the meeting area because people were unhappy that the leader riku was allowing so many people to die in the island type two if you think you want a new leader oh that's a lot of twos then jesse the leader of the safe haven took over leadership i wish to create the create a safe place for people on this island somewhere where people can be free without violence and i ask all of you the people of this island to stand with me please are you with me the people were indeed with jesse jesse you are the new leader and i will not be as cruel as our previous leader over at the plaza business was booming but gluman's goods had a much better and profitable shop than bralo's barbecue and soon even the owners were starting to beef on the island gloman currently has more customers over here man why is this establishment not making money get your house out of here everything was come and people were just farming but soon the island would take a complete 180 and turn for the worse come on guys we need to talk in private come on private private private come on you make it way too easy baz way too easy guys you leaders don't know what they're doing wait harvest trapped me wait harvest trap me fake friend wait is what's going on what's going on i wonder harvest the rat from earlier who stole the parkour crate with his teammate daiko both trapped baz in their base and had a flame turf behind a door and they were about to murder him let's finish this boys one time forever you guys had died the most beloved character on the island was killed off i was innocent ly good things for the island boys well guess what he's now he's mine detective kills bears boys i'm holding a funeral if you would like to come to baza's funeral i'm gonna do it in iodine everyone please please come to the funeral everyone should be here that is so sad man best didn't deserve that today we hold the funeral of our friend bez two men named harvest and deco slime trapped him in a base and killed him with a flame turret harvest also died in the action but daiko is still out there we truly lost a good person today boys we'll miss you guys news got around fast that bats had died on the islands one person in particular was confusion and he made it his goal to avenge best but one person who did surprise me was evil bands this entire event they were arguing but evil baz said something i would have never expected let's see i could become mayor and fight for bad freedom hola i'm you can't go out like that i'm impressed with you you're growing and you're you're you're yes i see growth in you okay can you avenge bads for me okay can you kill deco sign for me yes i will get community to kill him it's the bottom of canine okay it's right there you go you have to take the man out pvp is about to be enabled you need to go bottom right of k9 okay yes sir all right go do it man yes do it go go go pvp is about to be enabled evil beds had changed he no longer had hatred for beds and it was his goal to kill the man who trapped and executed him pvp is enabled and pvp will be on until 40 people are alive so 20 of you will be dying 23 of you pvp was enabled again and this time a lot of characters would soon die no meanwhile ot was on the hunt and soon would proved their dominance on the server he's at i don't want to shoot him either he's gonna go on the roof i think you want that one dad i think i think wait confusion talk to us ready listen it wasn't part of the deal for man he wasn't part of the deal and that guy is neither ot killed one of the confusion's teammates but what i discovered is confusion was secretly working with ot on the inside but ot continued to dominate and killed anyone in their path all right there's so many there's so many bro look at the bridge you guys ready i double the guy killed the guy that guy's low gear i could get him ot not nearby okay ot successfully killed a man on their hit list the former leader re-kid but there's a few people who didn't like the newly elected leader re-kid that was ot oh my god no kid man why so what is ot outside it is although ot was killing everyone in their path yexum who got the sniper rifle earlier from the parkour was able to use it against them the first ot member had died and now they have three players remaining ot dinling received a message from his teammate that one of his members were down and soon he would find the body of one of his dead brothers all right we made it to 40. good job everyone good job after that pvp stage there were 40 islanders remaining you alive jesse fancy what's up um it's just lost two now our group is gone jesse also lost a lot of teammates that round in his safe haven dream was short-lived how does it feel that you uh you took out one of the ot guys i just want to say that i want to be known from here on out as the greatest solo chat in rust how you going i did indeed you killed all of my friends eye for an eye mate eye for an eye read you those one of your friends you're just gonna sit in your base all day how did it feel losing a brother you lost one of your close guys listen fancy listen listen close we're in a war right now i won't have the time to be sitting here and feeling sorry for myself gotta get ready for that next pvp fizz and i gotta kill everybody on the second island the island went back to being calm again and everyone was nervously preparing for the next ppp stages all their friends were slowly disappearing from the island but then my advent gluman said this to me uh fantasy uh yeah there's some there's some dodgy dealings going on i need to get into a private call you real quick what do you mean uh saying cover on the admin related like i need to show you oh all right um i'll be right back uh what's happening all right let me share my screen he's given confusion stuff i tried to get a better angle but i can see through the door i'm too sure holy all right so bralo's helping confusion even though brothers seems like it all right don't tell anyone this yet let me try to figure this out okay glooman who owns one of the admin shops at the plaza discovered bralo was secretly spawning items for confusion in this event and clipped him in 4k so my own admin bralo was helping a player on the island behind his barbecue business he was running illegal trades perfect perfect but admins on this server also have one life and we needed to take him out i told bralo to meet me at the arena a landmark i haven't introduced yet yo brother can you uh go to the arena real quick bro meet me in the arena real quick okay this is where we do elimination challenges if not enough people died during the pvp stage and well since i can't do damage to people on the server i needed an islander to kill brawler so i knew the perfect people to go to i might need your help okay all right man i'm listening you guys are actually gonna help me with a uh a little side quest do you understand yeah i chose the best people on this island to help with that okay all right so you guys know bralo he's an admin for this event right now but apparently he is cheating and giving items to confusion oh no no no no keep your guns on him as soon as he takes it out i need you guys to kill him if he does okay let's go the only people i could rely on to kill barlow was ot and they understood the assignment get back to fancy sorry we got it bralo how you doing it's not fancy just take a seat so um what you've been doing at brother's barbecue how's business business has been pretty good actually what's this about have you had any customers named confusion not by lately hence the come by you know like quite often but like it's just for you know food and whatnot you know i think uh he's been coming over for a little bit more than just food hold up hold your horses buddy hold your horses buddy take a seat glooming sent me a clip giving spawned items to confusion can i allow that here man so anything you want to say about that justice was served to the island that night good boys good no hold on loop please confusion oh my god he was helping him bralo is no longer going to be an admin on right now um he was caught gloom and caught him spawning items for confusion so after that it was time for another pvp stage and we'd go until there's 25 players remaining immediately iok his group went over to ray daiko slime who had killed baz earlier but what iok's group didn't realize is that ot heard the raid and we're approaching them the two most feared groups were about to go at it we saw earlier how people feared i okay that's okay that's right okay and we obviously know about ot is capable of the first encounter they had was the last pvp round but this time they were on equal grands please both teams traded members ot lost one but iok was the only survivor led from his group and was stuck but the two ot players had no idea he was there foreign were eliminated the two biggest groups on the island died fighting each other and although iok came on top he was third partied right after but during this pvp stage majority of players were hiding in their bases and refusing to fight because they were so close to the end and it pissed me off because ot and iok's group were the only ones fighting and everyone was picky backing off their hard work and now both of those groups are eliminated so it brings us back to the arena because if people aren't gonna kill i'm just gonna do an elimination challenge and a lot more people were gonna die from this do you guys know the game simon says oh no oh yes who do we still have alive here you have b george yeah you have a good day there jerry all right the exum this is more crane jesse i plan on making a safe haven for players confusion at the end confusion why'd you cheat man why did you cheat come to the front confusion come to the front all these people played fairly but you got an advantage so i want everyone here to know that confusion is a threat i never want to watch a video of yours again fancy says jumping fancy says jump fancy says crouch stand up oh you sir come to the front oh please i'm so sorry man it's hard watching your friends dive right in front of you and there's nothing you can do about it but that's the punishment if not enough people died during the pvp stage you've been there since the start man before it happens hey everyone jump fancy says find a partner if you don't have a partner you're dead you guys have 30 seconds 30 seconds just do it sorry sorry your numbers you betrayed you stormy how do you feel he's on my team fancy stormy you just got faked out i salute you stormy it's like i owe you my life mama all right fancy says get another line one more person is gonna die i'm shaking beat crushed that's one more that's one more fancy you consider you guys so lucky you guys may leave fancy says you can leave after that elimination challenge four team players were left and we held the final meeting of the event look around guys this meeting area used to be filled with players earlier but now it's just us for the rest of the event pvp will be enabled and will go until three players are alive for the final elimination challenge you guys have five minutes had a few minutes to get ready for the final pvp stage but right before something unfortunate happened jesse just died please how did he die i went in his base and he had a flame turret and i activated it and he died by his own flame through it oh my god it's such an unlucky way to go out but jesse's teammate accidentally triggered a flame trap and jesse died in his own home the final pvp stage was enabled and things got intense natural disasters were activated and never informed teams at 2-3 because the final elimination challenge could hold three people confusion in the exub came together and they dominated this pvp stage but it wasn't until oh confusion confusion was down jackson now has the opportunity to kill someone who cheated who worked on the inside with other groups it was part of the deal the yexim saved him oh my god the pvp stage was long and drawn out but eventually the final three members were an islander named jj confusion and yexa and now it was time for the final elimination challenge to declare the winner of the island anytime there's a 1v1 situation in my videos i always do a wild west 1v1 but for the first time i'm introducing a triple threat wild west matchup when i shoot my python in the air it will turn around and kill your opponents the last man standing will win the island here we go well what's going on you see um me and jackson you know we are we are teammates i will not deprive us of this 1v1 but let's see you guys just killed your opponent look here just to turn this into a 1v1 are you serious yeah yeah yeah yeah if it had stayed as a 2v1 out in the field we would have beaten him anyway all right peter appears off get in position again boys you know how this one goes gentlemen turn around and take three steps forward the winner of this 1v1 keeps the entire server here we go oh my god okay fancy i i did play dirty and some of my strategies were unconventional uh yeah i'm aware i don't deserve this but i do know someone who does confusion outplayed the island he had kept a promise earlier in this event and wanted to give a reward to another player who deserved it more confusion are you sure you want to do this 100 all right gluman go in confusion is the winner of the first island video and gave the island to baz i want to do more or less to leave island videos and this was an open discord event i did with my viewers so if you'd like to join the next island experiment join my discord in the description to be a part of it,2023-01-16T18:00:10Z
Ho8FDae2uDc,My Viewers Tried Taking Over my Private Server,1240334,25410,1238,0 days 00:28:12,so every video i make i always include cinematics somewhere in the video for this video it was going to be the players defend a massive war that took place on my server deaths everywhere people screaming in hundreds of explosions in the distance now deserted completely wiped and empty and this is usually how it goes after my recordings i have to clean up everything on the server and record for the cinematics usually i grab discord members for my cinematics because for this video is going to require a lot of people first i needed a shot of people running up for the thumbnail okay let's spread out like some people forward some people in the back it doesn't need to be a straight line they look like a group you know right when i say go we all run forward look look the other one all right three two one go run run run run run oh yeah goods are beautiful this is great someone's good at making a monkey noise all right for this one i need everyone to pretend like they're in the classroom foreign but during the cinematic session i noticed some people were missing and soon after i found one of them building a church what is this over here what the hell hello huh what are you doing oh you're supposed to be you're supposed to be at the recording session you're building a church you're supposed to be recording and helping me with the video i'm going out of church there's no point no one plays on this yeah but this church is pretty fancy at the time i just ignored it i had to film the rest of the scenes and start editing that night i just assumed that since he's on my private server that no one plays on he'd eventually just get bored and leave so me and the other discord members finish up the cinematics and it was time for everyone to log off the server thank you for joining today it was a good recording session good job guys thank you for your hard work today we've lived in his basement for so long it was getting late and everyone logged off including myself but there's one man who did stay on that server when everyone left and his name was cheese you see when i logged off that night and went to bed she's made sure to keep the ip to my private server so he could log back on later now i don't know why he did this or what his motive was but he had a plan that night the server was completely empty and there was no one to bother him that night she's had a surfer all to himself and well he got right to work he farmed every stone node he farmed farm to the sites he had no pvps the only things we could do is fight scientists everything he did that night was by himself what used to be a massive war days earlier on the server was now taken over by a role player in his dreams that entire night he clocked in a 10 hour shift farming all alone and had some sort of passion to build on my private server and well i woke up the next day and logged on to my private server initially i thought i was going to record a few cinematics and get ready for my next video but i couldn't believe my eyes he created a masterpiece last night she's built an entire kingdom with high stone walls surrounding the entire circumference of where our main base used to be during the events all in vanilla rusty created a village by himself with pathways large furnaces at church and even a penthouse with running electricity foreign but i had to ignore this for now because i had a new video i needed to record on the private server a video series my og viewers might recognize rust odd man out a game show where i gathered seven players with a thousand hours and they had to find out who's the liar this was a recording for my second channel but when i arrived to the set grieved and destroyed not only did cheese build a kingdom last night but he found my building i was gonna use for this video taunting me and my discord saying he found my recording set i even put a sign saying please don't touch but cheese didn't care now this is an issue when it gets to the point where my viewers are starting to mess up my recordings that's where the line is drawn at first i was just gonna let cheese have his fun but when it interferes with my work it's a problem and cheese continued to spread the ip to his friends and other members of my discord and they were actually growing in numbers now i could just easily ban them but no no no no no i'm not that boring instead i was gonna raid them but i couldn't do it alone this was gonna require a few phone calls oh what's up fancy what fancy raid on your private server i called up all my close friends and members of the fancy orb community to have them join me on this raid i called my creator friends confusion and harvest i called in my entire staff team of admins and moderators and more prominent members of my community that you see in my video together we were gonna take out the kingdom and remove them from my private server i was born around baby it wouldn't be fair if we launched a surprise attack on the kingdom and i noticed together they were playing at my discord so i joined and told them to prepare for war in a couple hours now we own the server now oh we do you okay there will be more you don't own the server you are well you may understand i'll see you guys later all right prepare okay you can fancy you gotta practice your strength now that the kingdom knew that we were gonna raid them it was time to show my friends what we were up against yeah i want to go in and with them no no did i reread them oh we're right in there tonight don't don't do anything don't spoil anything they yeah they don't know how many i'm bringing okay i'm down you guys all down to raid tonight yeah sure yeah yeah sure okay it's gonna be like literally in the morning but i'll do it this is the second video a second channel i don't know it might be mean i'm i'm recording either way this is gonna be content actually i don't know man like this is this is something completely different i don't know like i don't know if this would be a man channel we'll see how it goes though it's not mean it's definitely second channel actually look at this look how ridiculous this is ready for it wait for it wait for it why is the compound so big a few hours had passed and it was time to raid the kingdom all of my friends are close members of my community gathered around and dropped whatever they were doing to help me with this raid meanwhile the kingdom was under high stress as they knew a raid was coming minutes away that they had little time to prepare for the kingdom didn't know how many people i was gonna bring but they were about to find out all right they don't think we're here yet so we're all gonna say shh so when i say go we're gonna send it at the exact same time and like as soon as they see that they know they're gonna get rated three two one go four my team was ready but before we launched our attack my community manager b george wanted to give a speech all right features please and letting us give us your words of motivation life today people have invaded our island yeah being george didn't know how to give a proper speech and he was definite discord so he didn't realize we were all laughing at him let's do this boys let's say fancy what that's a weirdo no no no no because we're going to redo that that was so stupid let me do it let me do it listen guys i never thought that they would come where someone would take over my private server these are the loyal multiple stickers in this community okay you see the people here these are the only people that care okay so you guys know in my videos we do something called the au chant where we raise our fists in the air and scream oh to get hyped up for war it's only proper we do it for this raid on my count boys three two one three two one three two one after that it was time to start the raid er all right game faces on boys i'll be there in a while and if i heard them i'd be stressing right now you guys see that church to our left that's what started this whole thing the first building they made on the server all right let's go everyone place your bags stash your backup kits okay holy dude they built so much now one thing the kingdom didn't realize is that they're on my private server and they have to play by my rules and i can activate whatever plugins i want so i assigned my attic lumen to be in a tank of course enough i'm gonna start walling someone pushes me yeah come on please let's open this up i'm behind by the house oh i'm down i'm down don't worry bro i gotta eat this time fancy good so if you did let me die this time no i'm stupid this kingdom was massive so our plan was to take over the church first from there we'd be able to use it as a raid base and slowly take over other buildings but none of that even mattered it wasn't even a challenge the kingdom had fallen my crew and i destroyed every building and left nothing for them massive war days earlier turned into a kingdom now into nothing but in the back of our heads we knew it wasn't a fair fight the kingdom had little ammunition and meds and we also had a tank when they had no ruckus to use against it i found cheese back at the first church that was built and he was defeated but what i was about to tell him would give him hope again boy hello there fancy hello cheese oh i tried to avoid you earlier but i said i'd do anything at all costs it's my server my rules very sorry that i but i didn't believe you you are truly the master of the server now cheese listened to me before you bow down and give up in front of all your people we may have won a battle if the war is not over yet you may rebuild your glory and better prepare you can try to rebuild stronger and better for a rematch and we will come back and ready once more to see who the true winner is interesting since there wasn't a fair fight i told cheese in 24 hours we would rate again he had one day to rebuild reorganize and prepare for another attack for now my team and i left the kingdom alone and we checked in a few hours later to stalk them around and see what they were up to see this aftermath they probably destroyed everything yeah if they've been if they're not dedicated oh maybe not oh wait what wait a second this is us they abandoned it we discovered that she's in his people abandoned their kingdom all those hours she's put into his kingdom was left behind to start a new journey all right now we find them where could these little rats be hiding oh oh the kingdom moved to a completely new spot originally where the first base was during this event these people are playing like a private server imagine a fancy rp like a waitlisted one i would love that after this bro like i could promote a server like this in this video as we were stalking the new kingdom we witness this cheese paying respect to the og church making a sign that says the disco base would be avenged but i needed inside information from the kingdom so i was gonna send one of my soldiers undercover and i knew the perfect person for this baz are you on the server yep this is baz you've all loved baz in my videos and he's a fan favorite on the channel now i'm sitting best in the new kingdom to be a spy i knew as soon as the new kingdom would see him they would get excited because everyone loves bears in my videos oh my god boys we got them we got them so bad best fit in pretty quickly with the group and he's even able to join them on the group photo but it wasn't until one of the kingdom members gave baz a gun and one thing you should know about bez is he is a beamer oh bat's got a kill oh oh my god that's a surprise is good at killing another kill again another kill oh my god there's another one on their best no oh no okay i gotta leave to school i think now it was the next day eight hours before the second kingdom raid and the kingdom expanded by a lot but yeah there this might be a little hard though it is it is gonna be there's 14 of them online right now 14 but while watching the kingdom we witnessed one of their meetings and soon my team and i would realize how difficult this raid was gonna be here thank you after all the hours the kingdom was putting in i could tell they were bonding over this experience their hatred grew for me after what i did to their first home but i still needed more intel so i sent the brains of my group harvest on the server and the information he gathered was going to be crucial you're about to witness a piece of history over here this is the first building that we any person has built on the server and it's still standing like fully yeah it's still standing it's legendary so why don't you guys like protect us like fancy could just come over here and just rate this we trust that he will protect the sanctuary he was here he was there when we first made it yeah we're just praying that he doesn't heard it so what are you trying to like protect like what what signifies the like that you've lost probably at the end of the day is the church that's all that means the church is all that matters i do i do hope you guys win this is like a nice community now it was 20 minutes before the raid but i noticed someone random was on the server wait harvest is this you hey what that's not me wait there's a random guy on the server i think uh i thought that's a part of everything yeah wait he's just building here uh hello i don't even think he has a mic for king of the refinery can you hear me can you hear me yes i can what's up nothing much i put in my mic wait how did you even join the server dude i was on another monthly white server in my cyber white so i decided to try something new and then yeah trying to figure out what this service is all about now we actually had no idea who this was my private server is on the server listing so anyone can join this and because so many people were online for the raid that was about to happen humvee here thought it was a normal server with normal players but he didn't realize he dropped in right when a massive raid was about to go down so i sat him down and explained to humvee what he just joined in on humvee let me tell you a story let me tell you some lore about this server a few days ago there was a massive battle on the server hundreds of deaths explosions and everything to kid but then someone came in to rebuild a new kingdom it was peaceful there were villagers but a big bad wolf came in and destroyed the entire kingdom he forced all the villagers to to leave and abandon their home those villagers went to a new area and they've rebuilt their kingdom made it stronger made it better recruited more villagers but the big bad wolf noticed this he didn't like it why don't you come with come with us i'll be let us show you something i want you to see something with your own eyes wondering if you're the big bad wolf just listen all right there's two stars there's two sides to every story mr humphy okay you have to understand both sides because the big bad wolf had a reason you know this was their kingdom humvee i want you to take a good look around this used to be a church actually this is where the pope would stands everyone would sit and listen to his prayers however is no longer look around mr humvee this place is not a church anymore building used to be a penthouse with a pool a humvee it's all gone this was the kingdom that the big bad wolf destroyed so i want you to understand something humvee okay i am that big bad wolf see in the chat you see that in the chat team minus 10 minutes those are the villagers there's another war about to happen and i'm wondering if you would join us for this war humpty absolutely first come first serve now you might already know who humvee is without even realizing it i didn't find out till later but if you remember the ksi versus logan paul fight there was a guy who went viral for streaming the fight through his glasses i'm not making this up that is humvee i just want to let you know this is my server okay these people they're building on my server they are the enemies i am not the bad guy i promise you humvee we are the good guys yeah hitler said the same thing come on man you call him liber bro damn but now it was time to get ready for the second raid and humvee would be joining us all right everyone load in um when you're in tell me how are you feeling i'm uh are you nervous i'm excited no you guys say like y'all already we all ready good man good just hang tight i gathered up my team and everyone was ready for the second kingdom raid now it was time to have the final meeting with cheese know me well cheese this is it we will have one stipulation for this battle if i win i apply a white list to my private server and no one will be able to join ever again but if you win the whitelist is not going to affect and i will keep my private server open that's pretty fair to me well we are done here then let's check on it after that cheese went back to his people and told them the news if they lost this raid everything they fought and built for would be gone but this time they had a better defense more guns more firepower and even outnumbered us two to one the kingdom was expecting us to attack them right away but i wanted to pay a visit to their first original church that started this whole thing fancy code just come over here and just read this we trust that he will protect the sega we're just praying that he doesn't hurt him foreign take a seat this is the first church that they built this has a lot of meaning to them but today once they realize that we're here we're about to destroy their pure building they're gonna freak out three two one go blow it up boys let's go this church no no no no yeah we're there no no i built that i built that church no no no no no no no no um morale as much as possible they're trying to lower they're not they're not dude it could be a distraction it could be a distraction don't don't everyone go the whole reason why this thing started and they freaking destroyed it they raided it yeah but this church is for you fancy am i an for that it is war at the end of the day but i just made it a hundred times more personal all right let's go let's go back in that shirt oh my god that was so close all right let's go let's go let's go left side left side that's when i realized it we're not even two minutes into this raid we just landed our scrap valleys and they're already plaguing us on our side we haven't even shot a single rocky and this is because they had sleeping bags in every single grid possible headshot dead go i need to kill left side focus left headshots all right we need to start pushing up and getting rockets start opening walls open walls let's let's begin let's get a breach we can build like a funnel type thing we were struggling to even make a breach in the first wall because there's so many people flanking us roman i might say i couldn't get the tank again do the tank get the tank get the tank i don't care get the tank get the tank glooming all right i got you got like four pushing in right now there's literally like four funky minds right now oh god that's bradley okay he's ready to come in all right what's the status guys are we are we trying to get in the base here right side we're breaking tc's we're gonna start pushing in there's a tower in the kingdom that was preventing us from getting deeper into the village we needed to take control of this if we were to continue this raid oh we need to take down that tower i got you fancy i think you stood right up there oh no we're not making any progress i think we should back away and then regroup and build like a coordinated push together all right let's let's stop attacking everyone back out everyone yeah everyone everyone let's attack somewhere else listen guys it's not looking good out there this is this is one of her last final shots sorry we're all grouped together we're all just gonna do one less one last shot here okay does anyone any suggestions on what we could do here um i think i have a suggestion yes brother what is it they know we've been coming from the beaches this whole time gotta change up the the course of action maybe we go from a different angle glooming right here where where's glooming glooming where are you yep i need you to go to ot island and get the mlrs ready all right yes everyone else we're gonna attack together okay after regrouping our new strategy was to take over one of their buildings on the cliffside after gloom and mlrs is the base we're going to pummel them with rockets using their own building foreign foreign but everything we tried did not work they had too many people in so many bases but we were gonna try one more idea we were just gonna full send on the top of their base as our last effort and if this doesn't work we would have no choice but to forfeit all right here we go boys this is our final chance here all right go ahead and uh go ahead and fly deco go ahead and fly guys if this doesn't work i appreciate you being here one more out on me boys three two one three two one yeah i'll try if we left we left home this this wasn't his war guys this was not his war we we dragged him into it he needs to stay there i like out of all people that got left go go okay i'm down mom dead oh no i just rocking his ass still alive oh you rock it in my ass bro what are you doing in there oh geez you've you've defeated me i will give it to you you have organized your men well and you guys were prepared and so i will say the whitelists will not go into effect and you guys have saved the private server for yourself thank you fancy we appreciate your efforts the kingdom had won and as promised in our treaty i didn't put a white list on the server but there's one person who missed the ending to that war someone we left behind foreign now uh you know that story i told you earlier yeah about the big bad wolf yeah we need to finish that story take a seat when the big bad wolf raided the new kingdom he was cocky and confident but what he didn't realize is that the new kingdom grew much stronger they had better defenses better weapons but overall they became brothers although they lost something that was very special to them they pulled together and in the end they were able to defeat the big bad wolf and that humvee is the end of our story the big bad wolf lost and i was a part of the big bad wolf yes humvee you were but the private server wars has just begun because of this story my private server is public for anyone to play on now i must warn you if you do play on it it isn't a normal server because i will do crazy things like you saw today i'm looking for more stories to build like this so this is my ip to my private server and have fun playing,2022-12-20T19:00:06Z
dRPwU6Nrt2I,I Played with the Smartest Farmers in Rust - A Rust Movie,3241320,78827,5389,0 days 00:54:41,below me are the smartest farmers than rust you might be asking why would i play with these guys they're just farmers you see i couldn't play with the smartest pvps or the smartest builders but the smartest farmers know a few secrets that only one percent of players know how to do but there's one problem i have to admit i haven't played a rough swipe in over two years on my channel you're used to seeing me doing challenge videos 100 player experiments and other videos where it's not me playing proper rust there hasn't been a single time where you've seen me post a gameplay video it's always a challenge based video on my private server so does this even make me a rust youtuber if i don't play the game for how it is there's so many lessons to learn in rust so that's why i gathered actual russ youtubers to guide me through the mistakes and make this way so i started up rustin went to a freshly wiped stevia server when a 90 player q this is why i don't play russ this stevie what did you say i uh stevie it was just it was just a meme i i was joking no no i just wanted to make sure that i heard you right go ahead and repeat for me what you just said one more time i thought that wasn't me man stevie please i'm sorry where are you going buddy i loaded into the server and met up with my team mr fancy hello hello okay so we have like um our startup base right now this is empire in conrad the smartest farmers in rust and they'll be my teammates in this video the two farmers usually play rust in a peaceful way off to the side of a map in a tier one area where no sweaty pv peers would bother them why was he staring at me like that our neighbor was giving me a little weird vibes but i just assumed that's maybe how rust players are nowadays i hear a bear over there guys oh guys there's the bear oh my gosh there's somewhere there's someone over here i'm traumatized i don't know who this is where's the bear there it is again this guy was also giving me a weird stare and at this point i knew something had to be wrong was it really my ugly character model and then he pointed at me and that's when i realized it i forgot to change my steam name every rust content creator that plays this game changes their steam name before joining a server because once you get recognized it's over you see there's a lot of weirdos on the internet who think they can get in your video and become famous if they follow you around and purposely try to ruin your video or stream but because i've never had to do this i didn't realize i made this mistake and i couldn't change my name because that would require me to restart russ and if i did that i would have to go back to the queue and wait another four hours and get yelled at by stevie again yeah that's one of the biggest mistakes you could have made man i know but it's my first wife in over two years my steam name has always been fancyorp it's all right man it's okay to fumble the bag every once in a while go out there and try to make the best of things this is fancy or bro this is not orbs everyone gather around okay our goal of this swipe is to make a village and me and the farmers here are working to build a massive cloth farm and we can supply the entire village are you guys down to build around here around this river yeah i had to make sure these two don't snitch me out so to keep everyone on the same page i randomly decided let's just build a small village and so i guess that was the plan for now we were gonna make a small community on this beautiful river and give out all the cloth the farmer's harvest and everything was just gonna stay peaceful ridge and gustavo do you guys have a base around here i got the base i'm trying to get a start for like three years okay all right build around here okay this is like the safe area and we work together okay if there's anyone that taxes group we band together we should invite them to the team conrad all right everybody good luck all right go build your bases all right so guys how do we get started on this cloth empire you guys are like the best farmers in rust so like tell me how to get this process started today's day one what do we do yeah we found a lot of scrap also we need a lot of stone okay so you stay in focus on scrap and then stone okay sweet well then yeah let's get started i guess so scrapping stone should be it every wipe the farmers create this massive bulky base that has five floors and every one of those floors will have thousands of cloth now each farmer will give me their own lesson on why they are the smartest but first we need to get this base going now this is a giant base and i'm not trying to farm all day how long is this thing gonna take again it usually takes about half a day or a day to set up the farm it does take quite some time this was gonna take a ton of time but while we were talking our other neighbor who was a bit more geared approached our base yeah is that a geared guy yeah hello i appreciate it oh no oh what's going on are you nearby the area this is aspect and he lives right down the river from us i noticed he had a gun and he could easily wipe us on the floor right now at this point i'm praying he isn't a bad guy i'm just curious what's her name you can call me chad farmer chad that is wait wait tommy oh yeah okay let's do it yo yo yo i can't donate some stuff scrap if i'm not gonna need it when i get it yeah yeah thank you man oh man dude i actually thought he was better just kill us all aspect was a friendly neighbor and offered to help us and so far all things were good with this space design we have not gotten rated a single time you guys have never been rated we have never been raided with the space it is a complicated route like the hallways and stuff it definitely will throw people off guard i think it's just very different than what people are used to yeah guys i think there's one more thing we need to do so i can be officially in the group i need my farmer outfits oh cool so i didn't even think about that it's time for farmer chat to officially join and at this point i was officially a farmer for the rest of the wife unless i die you will never see me in this video without wearing a farmer outfit i was now locked in and ready to begin my adventure and just to let you know if someone kills you and steals your farm or outfit that's wall it's oh it's war it's personal yeah soon we had people giving us gifts because everyone wanted to see the village thrive all right add slim to the group conrad oh my god are you sure have fun yeah oh aspect you're a good man we will use this to defend the farm but more importantly the village there's like nice people on the server man yeah yeah so far everyone's been pretty cool only the real only issue we've ever had is the is the bear that's like your biggest problem whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa got you i got you got you whoa whoa whoa what's happening he attacked the farmer yo i got the boys coming someone attacked conrad yeah he's he's dead now oh aspect are these your friends we only kill the naked with a rock and it wasn't even a big deal but aspect and his two friends came over with guns it kind of showed us that these guys truly did want to help us out even if the problem was small at this point tons of people are finding our village but i saw this as an opportunity we could easily get our farm base going if everyone helped pitch in and well everyone was ready to help to get this cloth going we're gonna need stone and we need scrap okay so if you guys have any spare scrap or stone to donate hit up any of the farmers okay and if you want a farmer outfit you let us know we'll give you a farmer outfit here you go oh my god slim shady just gave me 681 scrap oh my gosh bro holy crap they just casually gave me a 6k stone oh my god thank you so much oh my gosh oh my gosh wow wait are we gonna be able to like finish the the outline of the base with all the stone that we have yeah i think so the outside should be able to be finished all right so should i tell everyone we're in phase two now that we need scrapbooks yeah i think you could do that what's up slim shady don't or your top your top donator oh my god where'd you get that metal chest plate i had three of those transplants don't you worry i have three of them no i'm the top donator yes sir you're the top g and top donator this is slim shady and he calls himself the top donator now i don't know what this kid does but he somehow magically comes home with a ton of loot he's gonna be an important ally for this wipe it was getting late for farmer empire so he logged off i see the uh the pumps are going in the river very nice wait i have a question so if we give you scrappy do you give us a teas and all that so pretty much we're just going to be giving back once this farm is fully going because we'll just have way too much cloth okay that's what you're doing for the youtube videos think about doing wait what i don't know what he's talking about i really missed youtuber or something remember when i mentioned there's a lot of weirdos in this game who will do anything to mess up a youtuber's video well as soon as trega blew my cover schmickle here was slowly become one of these people i'm trying to avoid yo is everything okay slim shady yeah no we've been dealing with door campers really look at the lou come in yeah dude take anything you need bro take anything you need fancy one of the villagers has a rocket launcher seems like a chad he knows what he's doing oh my god would you say we've uh gotten a lot more progress done than um anticipated so much more i mean this is like a whole day of progress for me and empire yo yo yo can i come with you guys yes sir wait let me just get you a diving kit oh hell yeah slim shady and some villagers were going to the underwater labs and this would be my first time doing so don't forget you have to get out you have to get out say boys we'll come back where are we going guys where are we going we're going underwater labs is there gonna be people here you think i've never i've actually never done underwater labs if i'm gonna underwater live it's one of the most contested monuments and stevia's it's clear clear clear i'm clearing the third level if a gun guy wants to come up here i'm your top donator for a reason oh no close the door close the door someone's coming closer did you really just die to an underwater lab scientist an npc fancy yes i know okay but it was my first time taking it okay what do you expect let me stop you right there you see this news flash there's guns in the game get your hands on one and come back blue was right we needed more guns especially to defend the villages more people on the server were starting to find out what was happening what happened fancy i got killed by a scientist the villagers came back from underwater labs and brought us home some loot all right can you get bro from the water oh you remembered nubian improved thank you so much bro remember it means a lot can i talk to you i oh no he just yeah don't make me kill you get the out of here don't ever come back again uh conrad um what's going on conrad i want you to hold something for me okay oh my god have you ever seen a rocket launcher in any of your farms conrad oh my god where did you get this we have to put this inside the car i agree we need to put this in the safest place in this farm you got your first rocket launch right so what are you gonna do with it well i'm actually not sure i don't even think we need it i don't have anyone to read yeah don't get too comfortable too soon friend there's always someone to raid eventually the wrong person will come around and you'll have to take him out before he raids you although we were getting a lot of progress the village was starting to gain way too many people things were getting stressful and the villagers were starting to argue are they still fighting guys stop fighting you guys are being like little kids all right all right everyone gather around everyone everyone gather around listen we can't fit you all on the team okay baby steps baby steps all right we're all on the same page we're all on the same team i want to talk to if i can though fancy no talking what the main issue is everyone wanted to be on me and the farmer's team ui but we could only fit eight people obviously we can't fit everyone on the same team and people didn't like that they stopped fighting about the bus on on the team and i just i have no idea what to say yeah no let's keep this group oh my god it died what's happening what's happening what the on day one tons of grubs were attacking village members and most of these villagers weren't good at pvp these toxic players were taking advantage of them but to be honest this used to be me as well this is my first wife in over two years but when i started playing this game in 2016 i was also a toxic player i backstabbed so many groups in the past i've changed door codes on allies anytime i had an advantage to steal loot i would have done it six years later i'm now in the receiving side of this treatment and it's karma that i have to deal with see over here fancy what's going on guys he went deep on us that's not a villager both of you shut up let me talk you guys aren't in the ones that are in the boat to talk i'll despawn right now smiggle went deep on one of the villagers and threatened to despawn loop this was our first threat to the village i'm trying to talk to talk to stealing my stuff if it's theirs you gotta communicate like every time you pull up to someone oh what is going on what is going on oh we're having our first village warfare it's a civil war right now this is bad because now they're gonna start door camping us and people are gonna have to oh no this is about this is this is bad so you finally realize that big groups in rust suck huh yeah this is exactly what i was trying to avoid starts getting chaotic when more people join well if it were me i would leave all that a lot and head off live in this begin my solo adventure but you're not me and you've got people relying on the fancy so lead them or trust me something will go wrong if you don't do anything about it soon kill smiggle he has been explaining smiggle you are banned from the kingdom listen leave he's a bad man all right and you were you you were not in the wrong and there it is the exact thing i was trying to avoid like i mentioned earlier there are tons of weirdos in this game who will ruin everything they can for a bit of attention and now our coordinates were blasted in the chat and the whole village is vulnerable to anyone who wants to ruin now anything could happen at this point a clan could pull up and wipe the entire village an army of grubs could door camp us all day or anyone could just mlrs us and everything would be gone so this called for a village meeting oh no oh no this is bad um oh my god conrad i'm sorry come inside come inside everyone everyone upstairs upstairs top floor very top floor go go go go go go get upstairs get upstairs therefore something something bad has happened boys we've been snitched out all right smiggle just called me on the chat and people are people know i'm on here now he just blasted our coordinates so we might get a lot of weird people okay so everyone we band together we stay together okay we must defend this village at all costs jesus christ yeah kill smiggle smiggle you were finished so i really need you to up to security around here man okay okay thank you i trust you i trust you and connor have to do it yes we will for slim i need protection on this in the city okay you got that slim don't you worry about it all right you're my best guy out here right 2.5 k hours for nothing our village was vulnerable to anyone who wants to ruin it but we had slim shitty as our security we had villagers to defend and our neighbor aspect in this group is nearby to help us out it would be tough to rate us the main the farmer's goal was to get the cloth farm going now in rust there are plant genetics and if you have good genes in a plant you get a lot more cloth than normal and i was a little curious on how you get the perfect genetics i have some seeds can you show me how to like do the thing maybe i can get like a good seed clone i mean yeah all right fancy are you ready for your first lesson yes i am so you're going to plant the seeds and tell me if the seed is good or not all right that sounds pretty easy oh that's good um what it's means there's like two w's no okay not bad that's a no-go big no-go oh god no why is it so frustrating man next one come on please tell me that's good please um one of these has to be good it's not the best oh my god okay no no no no no no no no no no no no no oh that's so good no no that's gotta be yes really nope even i know that one's bad it's terrible oh that's that's gotta be good greens baby um it's pretty it's pretty good it's fine okay all right let's go baby let's go yeah i realized that finding plant genetics is actually hard so i'm just gonna let conrad do the farming it was getting late and everyone was starting to log off on day one see you tomorrow and before i logged off this was my last interaction with one of the villagers holy scare me bro why are you pulling up on me like that yo what is your name who is this i want to see your farm rise indeed it was going to rise on day two i wanted this village to grow much bigger but for now it was time to say goodbye to farmer conrad i'm telling you right now conrad i am dedicated to protect this farm that's all i want to hear that's amazing conrad i'm gonna head off for the first day it was very fun it was so much fun you know the progress we made today was insane that's just so much i almost have the perfect genetics and then i can just start farming weird man absolutely dude all right sounds good well i'm head off all right the farmers were so grateful man usually they'd still be building their base on day one but because of all the help we got we finished the base started the farmer we had guns in our rocket launcher the farmers have never seen a rocket launcher on day one let's get right into day two foreign look down there at the very bottom of the water all right let's go competition you say huh we did not no more look what happened to him you don't mess with us what were they what yeah holy so last night someone tried building their own cloth farm right next to us probably in hopes to steal customers and compete with us but do you remember a friend from yesterday aspect the man in the hazmat suits well apparently he raided them last night because he didn't want us to have competition and i imagine it went something like this all right everyone move in let's go let's go who who's got the c4 yep c4's going down now three two one one more one more second c4 going now okay okay go go everyone push it dead he's dead we got him so there's a farmer here huh well that's good that we got rid of him i actually never saw aspect in this group ever again that wipe that would be the last time we ever hear from him but his last active kindness stuck with me for the rest of the wipe hello empire hello how are you doing yes hello on day two we've made a discord server for the village that way everyone stayed organized and we could communicate more effectively why don't you show me the progress uh that you've made yes of course i'm not sure how long you stayed on with conrad last night but all of the planter boxes has now been placed we can go have a look but the first floor here and it's all ready to harvest now my god wait so this is all ready to be harvest this is all ready to be harvested and the next one everyone ready as well wow wow well the third floor wow third floor is done they look kinda identical but they should all be ready the farm was in full production and every floor had cloth waiting to be harvested now a normal hemp plant would give you 10 o'clock but since farmer conrad made the best jeans last night we get just a little bit more let's see how much cloth we're gonna get for this harvest whoa one cloth gives you 120 60. yes exactly oh my god now we were rich in cloth and every harvest gave us 160 000 cloth yo what's up boys you made the discord server yeah it's join it you're gonna post the link i didn't get an invite it's in the chat all right fancy are you ready for my lesson yeah let's do it man so i'm going to show you what we can do with all of this cloth if we go to bandit game and sell it all to the vendor we can get a ton of scrap empire's lesson was showing me what we can do with the cloth there's a vendor at bandicam that lets you sell cloth for scrap and that's exactly where we went let's do it come on oh it's very close i just actually painted this very closely yeah i'll post this a bit further this is a very safe right there oh around the area oh oh why are they shooting we should be in the safe zone now gosh i'm getting so much scrub i sold all of our cloth and we got 6 000 and scrap in return but then i realized something can i buy an lr real quick just to see a supply yeah of course you can buy like 20 of them if you want to we can buy guns too do you want to go to outpost as well yeah yeah we're getting oh there's a guy on the roof lift yeah just drive past straight past just right past oh oh my god oh spicy he's gonna shoot at us again oh man those stars are some aggressive guys yeah yeah we've got uh people over there on those guys there might be a target right there they're gonna give us issues true this base was giving us issues flying to and from bandicam they didn't kill us but they'd be a future problem when we do more cloth runs we'll call them the bandit guardians but all right we got home safe we're good nice disco yeah oh yeah let's go right to our boxes that was a bit risky i had not seen those guys online that adrenaline right there holy crap oh man dude this is so exciting we just got five guns baby from farming yes all right and now that we have all this crap we're going to outpost now to catch it all in for a ton of metal fragments now that we traded the cloth we could buy resources like metal at outpost by doing this process we essentially have unlimited resources and guns we fiber cloth at our base and we go to bandicam to trade it for scrapping guns then we go to outpost and trade the scrapper resources and then come home with all the goods and then we repeat a little nervous but we got this oh look when the bases over there what is that i think that's a horse farm or something what just buy everything you can this is so broken 32 000 metal frags dude that's crazy with one farm run now we can just upgrade our base yeah i'm pretty sure that's a whole spam down there you wanna like you want to hijack that farm and take it like later in the in the swipe yeah sure why not off and on for like maybe probably almost 10 hours today oh my god and literally there's so many people who just come by and asked like is this where fancy orb lives no way really yeah word of mouth i think too it really is so when people just you come by and ask because of all the metal frags we bought we were able to upgrade our giant base to sheet metal oh it's all metal now hey fancy hey what's up you ready oh my god i i was i i wasn't actually serious empire you we i was kind of joking but you said it man not me i think we should do it are you sure this is a good idea what are you talking about of course this is a good idea look at the base i know but like for some horses are you are you sure about this man yes there's gonna be so much loot in there go all right all right back up back up back up what about your vote we only win with both yes yes wait that oh my oh my god why are there so much holy crap the second floor is this one oh my god we hit a jackpot here now since we had all this cloth we decided let's just do another cloth run what could go wrong dude i love this so much it's kind of fun yeah we have to find like that perfect angle right in the middle between the the trees here damn it no i died that was bad that was the last thing we wanted to happen i i lost the tommy or hey tommy awesome fine metal face mask and chest plate but more importantly all that cloth is gone oh the cloth that's the worst part congratulations for what i died well you did but you found your enemy yes but it's just a random guy who left bandicamp i will probably never see him again dude that's not the right mentality fancy any other player would go out and try and find him just don't give up so easily let me go do a little investigating oh wow are you at we're tight now yeah i'm trying to find my body i searched everywhere for my body and nothing was to be found tom b took my gun my armor and my cloth but more importantly he took my farmer outfit and if you remember what was said earlier and just to let you know if someone kills you and steals your farmer outfit that's wall oh it's more it's personal yeah i needed to find this man let me look and see who is at this base of who's in this base i i gotta try to find that owner i decided to go visit the bandit guardians from earlier just in case this might be where tombi lives it's okay man i'll pick you up picking you up man all right you are with i don't even know oh you just this was not tommy but i decided i should go back and check one more time since there were a few other people i'm gonna go back one more time these guys could be a potential issue yeah they already shot at us on their first run it just i mean they were pretty aggressive oh i see you on the map you're just exactly what the guy shot us yeah foreign no shot wait what what happened empire i found him found tom b the person who shot us wait a minute there's no way he lives they are the banded camp guardians at s12 no way tompi is a part of the bandit guardian him and his two buddies zero iq and the plug were also basing with him and they were geared and they had guns but because they stole our cloth and our farmer's outfit it was a war crime and we needed to get the village involved we need to have a meeting they stole our club they come up get away with that listen boys this village has been very successful okay we've met a lot of good people and we've built a lot of great things empire and i just went to another farm run and someone shot us down oh we win with a full inventory of cloth we don't let that fly when someone takes our cloth it's personal at that point these are the people we need to take out do you guys understand this yes yes okay because there's only two people in this group who are good at pvp and rating we needed help so on day three slim shitty said he would bring in five of his best guys that are good at pvp the bandit guardians needed to go but this would be my first raid in years this had to be the perfect raid tomorrow we would raid the bandit guardian so the rest of today was to prepare hello oh my god sleepy sleepy my clock didn't ring oh no conrad we've got enemies now we have a bit of a problem what's going on ah hello conrad there you are leave your team can you stop working on a compound around the village oh yeah yeah let's do that let's do that we gotta secure this place the next goal for the village was to compound the entire thing with high walls this would add more security and prevent randoms from coming in and attacking us it's horrible oh the walls are on the oh i love this the walls are forming yeah it's looking so good already everyone in the village was getting ready for the perfect raid while the villagers were setting up the walls alice crafting gunpowder the farmers were doing more cloth runs and slim shady was crafting all the explosives tomorrow was gonna be the big day i want to come look at the base of operations for the boom i'm coming i mean tomorrow's the day by the way tomorrow i you think you bring five of your boys on who are like really good at pvp yeah i could get i could get some oh nice yeah we had her so we got to run a half a gp in total oh my god that's as much as i could craft jesus you want to go to the gas station with me see if there's any guys that we can kill and get some uh get some comps on the way there sure me and some villagers went to a nearby gas station to farm up but it didn't last long when this happened today yeah it's a code red why the stumble is saying there's a lot of people outside the shop wait is the village he said he doesn't know they might be camping over here it's still like two thomas from me and stuff it's fine we can just shoot that out it's easy to see look i can start ecoating it right now where are they though like who's with us all right well we'll just kill them right here killed him killed him we had no idea who this guy was but then i saw his character model and i recognize this ugly ass character model instantly it was schmiegel from yesterday you are banned from the kingdom and then i heard that voice and it was confirmed see this good night i have not come back we need to put the gates up i'm gonna get more walls i'll be right back just don't don't let them tc grief it so do we only need one more unless we can go boys let's go that's smiggle is that smiggle okay he's trying to change his voice it's like there's a lot of you shut up come here we know who you are little smiggle realized the village was much stronger this time we had guns walls and we were more unified soon after that interaction we never saw him again and it truly showed that everyone in the village sticks together we are a family what the hell oh well isn't that sweet you and your little villager buddies you think you roll a family now yeah we are ramsay well fancy oop while it may seem like luscious green pastures now just remember this where there was eden there was also a snake day two was complete and everything was ready for tomorrow village is beautiful i know it's dude it's awesome dude and we have a beautiful river that goes through it i'll see you tomorrow for the raid okay i know yep my friends are getting on we'll see you tomorrow fancy all right thank you slim i'm heading off for day two i think day two very successful once again yeah it was so fun well i will see you tomorrow all right see you tomorrow today is day three and at 8pm tonight we execute the perfect raid let's go boys we are not rated all right now we go outside and take a look at the village last night everything was perfectly set up nothing could go wrong please don't be anything wrong when i open this door the village doubled in size overnight and that explains why 12 more people joined the village discord last night and some of these people weren't even the five pvp friends that slim brought in we were already under high stress and this is the last thing we needed all right slim i have to ask you all right last night i said bring five of your boys you brought like the whole squad my guy um well why'd you bring so many i i i i just i just tweeted out who who's free okay what's going on my brother by the way fancy you should have an ak in there somewhere i give it to your teammate oh good man good yo yo come here bro i think we have the same player model the first new villager i had met was a kid named donkey he was one of slim's friends and we bonded over the fact that we had the same character model ain't no way bro ain't no way when it turns day i'm gonna scout their base again just to see if they upgraded it because yesterday was like a two by two honeycomb but like a shooting floor so i don't know what it's like right now yeah it's the same thing but it's all metal oh all right i mean we'll be fine but we got more sulfur and i can go far but if you need i'll go grab a jack camera yeah i mean whatever helps man we can craft as many rockets it was still early in the day and everyone was waking up so i decided to do my normal routine on checking the farm let's go take a look at the farm hopefully this is fully prepared oh that's just a beautiful scene why is the hell are you shooting at the village yo fancy can we take attack heli or like is it gonna uh yeah go for it bro if you can take it do it all right i guess we're taking hilly oh my god this thing's so low no they got it let's go with all these new pvps slim shady brought into the village we are now doing things like taking heli before we'd never do that as it was too dangerous to the village and it would destroy building day three just felt different something was off oh okay i have to go now oh my god yo be good up here boys yeah we killed them all fancy good okay but slim shady didn't lie these people were good at pvp they took down heli and killed five people who tried to counter it i was starting to feel a bit more confident about this group is anybody inside here state your name in purpose i'm a farmer my name is farmer chad let's find out what a day we're having oh my god what the hell i could have um 50 50 logo 50 low grade yeah give me a second would be very nice a new villager named simon asked if he could have some low-grade in cloth in as a friendly villager i decided to help him out hello i'm simon how you doing thank you very much then i realized what it was actually for i've obtained that's what you're just making a molotov from that guy damn it yeah freedom before the raid we were crafting the last of our rockets because the banded guardians were online the perfect raid was going to be an online one this is all all right when you got rockets just put in the dropbox yes sir i have to go to dinner in like an hour or so and after that i miss public radio we'll be ready by then don't you worry bro we'll be ready cannot lose this do you understand like the stakes right now i promise you fancy will want to lose this bro my team is very dependable all right man all right to keep it as organized as possible the only people allowed to go to the raid are the og villagers from day one and five of slim's pvp friends if all 20 people went to the raid it would be chaotic and out of control i just clip it when i kill kids yo come here bro listen stop throwing that all right you're being you're being a nuisance to the village all right stop that okay we're under high stress right now there's big happening later okay no more trolling all right no more trolling we're under serious it was just hours before the raid and simon was still throwing molotovs at people and just doing dumb that we didn't need right now him and his dumb ass meimeo hat were just getting extra whoa whoa whoa why what did you just say about my hat fancy all right i shouldn't have made the hat comment i'm sorry i mean fancy sometimes a little bit of trolling is okay i think you're just getting way too paranoid about this raid brother you need to just calm it down deep breaths okay see much better that's what you say but the trolling was taken to a next level so here's the big dear boy so you guys ready for this no i'm not because apparently the only kid with a full metal ak is sitting at beast but uh all right what we need oh stop killing me simon you idiot it's tiffany no all right chipmunk has killed me at least six so chipmunk is in here so you guys are things up all right so stop killing people in the village right if they're inside the village they're friendly you see i did that six times inside the village yeah simon keeps decking me and he stole my wife he is out of control yeah i know um he's been they're killing people the whole time the entire day he's been killing people on purpose and throwing molotovs and stuff simon tiffany is the ones who've gonna just killed yeah simon and his friend tiffany continued to kill people in the village day one villagers who've been here since the beginning and it was starting to piss people off i couldn't deal with this hours before the perfect raid so i had to set them straight they are not willing to corroborate all right let me go talk with them real quick i'll be right back all right you you guys are like actually the main problems of the village right now and i'm like very close to like kicking you guys out if you're not gonna like willing to cooperate the farmers are telling me that you guys are breaking everywhere what do you mean what are we supposed to cooperate with what do you mean bro i'm not mad or anything guys i'm not like kicking i just want like everything to be intact because all of a sudden people are saying you guys are you know killing people throwing molotovs and which i've seen you throw mild subs we're really just trying to keep things organized here man okay all right you guys you guys good uh uh yeah tiffany goodman everything is organized for the raid um we're bringing only certain people i have everything written on my notes and who's gonna do what korean also have you seen the party house i have not dude this is sick bro this is where we will celebrate i'm just confused i've been on locker than everybody you know grinding all their kids i'm the one that got all their teams bro like tell your teams to to man up then tell them to get on and do those are your boys talk to slim for one of them one of them never plays this game and only plays it like once a month oh my god that's a slim problem man wait what's going on down there you'll see like five hours the last two two weeks one of them already has 200 hours everything was falling apart last minute donkey and simon are now telling me the other pvp are slim shady button don't even main rust and one of them only has like 200 hours was slim really lying to me my own right-hand man going behind my back wait what's happening they're just saying that the people that slim brought in are aren't good peers and they don't really they don't mean rust so i'll talk to slim he said those are his best boys or something everything was just getting so messy and so stressful the perfect raid was falling apart i guess i'm gonna go to i have a dinner to go to but then i'll be back all right all right either way we are writing them at 8pm eastern and we must be victorious yeah so i'll be back on later boys all right man all right take it easy good luck see you now when i logged off to go to dinner there was no one to lead the group and things would go downhill even more conrad apparently apparently after me doing all this grinding i'm not coming to the raid but if fancy's there with an ak i will kill all nine of you and i have hours to do that so just be ready fancy better not have an akata's hands just don't blow up the village i don't know about that one put that down here put it down i'm shooting mean mile your boy had a date i could finally ease my mind after a stressful afternoon of rust i can't ah don't you worry about it don't you worry welcome my name is wellin and i'll be serving you this evening what can we get started with hello what's up so like we have like four like people in the village they're just keep killing us and they're grieving us and stuff yeah is it simon and um and they're just like spreading lies about it right now the thing is like can we just like can we just like get rid of them real quick yes i'll have cooked bear meat please cooked beer okay and how would you like that done uh fancy what's going on sorry give me one second guys what the is going on uh fancy we've got a problem the entire village is raiding donkey simon and tiffany oh my god all right i'm coming back wait fancy orb where are you going uh sir you haven't ordered your food yet oh my god apparently there is a new group chat that was made so i'm about to join thanks man i'm just gonna call the group chat this is too loud i only want to talk to slim and the farmers fancy the thing is we're taking oil rig right now that's the thing okay finish well guys what's going on what's happening i was freaking out at lunch today it's not exactly going as planned but so far we seem to have it under control somewhat so what happened right you remember tiffany donkey and simon those guys they're interesting is fancy obscured wait what i'll come to that right what's going on so i think those three guys they got kinda annoyed that they weren't invited to the raid you know so they started being really annoying they started killing everyone around here just killing everyone they saw they started saying that we had 200 hours because they were mad they weren't in the raid yeah one of them already had 200 hours right they were very mad yeah i don't know why like they weren't even here on day one uh basically we waited their base took it over did you write it in the village yes now where they do why are people saying my name and oh yeah so basically they're just going around the whole server just saying that we live in v12 with fancy yeah i think they told the the they told the dudes were raiding that we're gonna actually went to the base these were that we're gonna race and they're also defending with them of course because donkey simon and tiffany weren't a part of the raid that's why they were being so obnoxious in the village and pissing other people off it's also the reason why they were spreading lies about slim shady in his five pvp friends donkey and simon were just jealous so when i was away for dinner the village raided them which caused them to go to the bandit guardians and snitch us out about the raid all the details about the perfect rate were in the discord and now the bandit guards know every single part of it and now donkey simon and tiffany were helping them defend the base we were betrayed by our own people fancy look at me what's the number one rule in rust yes i know i know you're gonna say don't trust people unrest is that what you're gonna say of course everyone in rust knows you can't trust anyone your perfect raid isn't going to work if you're going to be so naive wake up man so donkey i thought donkey was your teammate but he was your one of your boys that you brought in yeah he was but then like he just turned out like this like i didn't know what the happened to him bro he was he was chill earlier yeah he was chill like and then he just started griefing everyone like now he's like shaped every day there's just something new that's in our way blocking the village from success man another drink here someone carry this recycle recycle those what's that shooting the hell is going on here nah what is that we're getting ready fancy we're getting rated but actually i don't know who's who oh my god get on get on get on get on get on all right let's go let's go wait we're being raided right now someone get on right now right now right now who gives a get on right now all right we're leaving to a farmers get geared up farmers get geared up i'm going okay geared up let's go yeah close close all doors all doors need to be closed conrades i'm going to the roof with the uh with the full set i need to go into the court we were being raided by donkey simon and the bandit guardian it was a strategically planned attack while the pvps were on oil rig the only people at the village were me the farmers and the peaceful villagers two of my boys are suicided and are protecting right now the rest are pulling up in scrappy can you guys join the other vc yeah yeah let's go let's go yeah we can join the farmers get ready boys yeah yeah holy guys here we go we're coming back over here we're flying back right now we're flying back another way let's try to get the players yeah the clearest comes me and the farmers will be in our house defending from the top which base is getting ready right now do we know how many they are all right there the thumb i think yeah i'm landing scrapping on the right side of our base no one isolate if you isolate be at least in a group of two we're almost there where that vending machine is on the base that's where one is we're trying to build we're trying to build their push push that one step yeah they're trying they're rebuilding in the basement is that something wonderful is that something that waterfall there's someone in that big stone base in the middle of the party hills wait columns they're gonna use this as a raid base this is donkey in here bro donkey had controlled the party house and they were using it as a raid base and we had no choice but to rate it back hey guys we never take it back we need to take it yeah yeah we can four rocket this all right start shooting the wall that we're gonna race so they can't upgrade it to metal i'm giving you i'm giving you extra just in case just go go go go go go okay everyone everyone reload and we're gonna show at the same time everyone move out three two one shoot oh my gosh up let's go boys oh man holy this is crazy bro i did not think this fight would turn into this bro we tried to steal our party house man that's just that's messed up this must be such a different light for you guys today was a hectic day and we decided to postpone the rate to tomorrow the enemies were too prepared but tomorrow would be the day we finished the day by taking oil rig and made more rockets to replace the ones we had to use today tomorrow it's our turn to raid them today is day four and the bandit guardians were online the perfect raid was minutes away oh my god look at the rockets dude look at them do i do i read for the m2 i can read a door for them too everyone listen up farmers are gonna give a speech we were just doing a little fun here and then times together but then something happened some of the people in the in this village they betrayed us we had to take them out because they were so annoying towards us yeah took and stole all of our clothes and they do not do that so let's what do you say guys let's rate them now i say we take them out yes empire we need words from you too man we need words from you too all right man i mean i think conrad already said most of it but i just want to say thank you to every single person here i know you've all done everything you can and you are going to do everything you can do in the future to protect this village and with that i want to thank each and every one of you three two one emote oh let's go all right boys it's time you see this news flash there's guns in the game that's one of the biggest mistakes you could have made man your perfect rate isn't going to work if you're gonna be so naive wake up man eventually the wrong person will come around and we'll have to take what he raids family now yeah you've got people relying on them so lead them i think you're just getting way too paranoid about this rain brother you need to just calm it down you're not loses do you understand lingual stakes i promise you fancy ones bro my team is very dependable dude that's not the right mentality any other player will go around 20 . at the beginning of this video i questioned if i was a rust youtuber since i don't actually play the game so throughout this video i had the youtubers i look up to reteach me important lessons in rust since i haven't played this game in over two years now i know i'm not the best player which is pretty clear in the video but the personal growth i experienced with a complete group of strangers is what made me turn this into a movie but it's time to put the emotions away because we're seconds away from the perfect rate i've been building up this way the three bandit guardians were teaming up with donkey and simon five people were defending this base all right is everyone ready and uh a personal message to donkey do you remember when you said but if fancy's there with an ak i will kill all nine of you so just be ready fancy better not have an ak in his hands well guess what i was using little buddy i'm gonna go yo from a jimmy i'm gonna crash to me i'm not landing there we just jump out okay vomit all right we're gonna be going on an angle english farmer jimmy all right jump jump jump someone journey floor hit him you probably keep going keep going keep going keep rocking just keep rocking you can jump into their shoes keep rocking guys i'm continuing that's it that's open i think that's open back you see he's gone tc is gone all right let's take this over then let's take this over one more one more hold on let's go go push nice we had done it the perfect raid was complete the plug zero iq speak english so simon the chipmunk what do we what are we supposed to cooperate with what do you mean bro donkey fancy better not have an ak in his hands and the man who started this all tom b our main goal we've been building up was complete and the village was finally at peace there was nothing left for us to accomplish since we've defeated our main enemy so the only thing left to do was say goodbye to the village tomorrow damn this vibe was amazing this was not how i expected the wipes to go when we started do you guys remember how this place started it started with the three of us on this river and now it ends with the three of us but we made a lot of friends on the way thank you for letting me be a farmer with you guys i'm gonna give you this farmer outfit back because i gotta go back to being fancy work we love you thank you for being here as well your boat's ready fancy slim done a lot for the village man i won't forget everything you did i'll miss you man this is it boys it was a good time now i don't normally make rust movies and i probably won't for a while so i have no idea if you guys are gonna even like this but if you'd like to see more fancier movies in the future let me know how i did with this one also the farmers made their own video from this white but there's tons of things in their video you didn't see in mind that video is on the screen now if you want to watch it,2022-11-15T19:00:19Z

we know the avengers were one step ahead of us hey guys somebody should check this out meet the smartest electricians in rust array and mr flack along with the secret camera system array installed all over this map he created his own uav system that tells you if enemies are near the base mr flack created a detection system where lights will shine on players making it really easy for their team to spot enemies and well we soon got to their base in the smartest pvps knew it was their time to shine i gathered six of the most badass pv peers in russian it was just another day of killing for them go yes no they're not even letting you get to that inner circle try to go around on the sides or something as the 100 players got closer to the battlefield they soon realized the smartest trap basers built traps all over the battlefield including an electric field snowy landmines in a fake shop where you can trade your pants for a case but it's a bait shop that activates auto turrets holy crap yo kcr traps are mowing them down really getting massacred someone bought it where's the skill slim wait what do you know it's slim what are you doing you guys are actually throwing right now the 100 players are struggling to even get close to the base not only did they have to focus on the smartest players on the battlefield they also had to deal with the smartest pilots in the air my pvp rocket them fantastic dude give me upside down hp oh god i'm getting woozy the smartest pilots for distracting the 100 players from moving in so i decided to give the boys a little air support you know what i have an idea go ahead and activate the jet pack kit thank you i'll throw you with the jet pack they have jet packs they're flying around okay how do i get one of those bro now jetpacks and russ are fun and the smartest players couldn't resist trying them i bet oh i use this thing we might need faster ground transportation too rollo are you here i'm here fancy are you ready to open up bralo's repair shop yep it's open and ready my avid brawler opened up a repair shop to all the players so we could get some armored vehicles on the battlefield and soon he had a massive line of customers foreign was able to sell tons of armored vehicles for the players some people played an armor and others painted jet packs for you now i i work for you now and you just sweep the floors yeah take take this and start sweeping the floors back on the bed of things were getting crazy and it might be because kills falcon and coma they're the smartest duo in russ because they each have 11 000 hours in rust and are literally brothers in real life putting them together is the ultimate 22 000 hour duo and right oh my god fine i'm gonna try and hold you they're almost too dead fine fine i'm low there's like no one over here tony ass that's good yeah no it's a good spot but we're holding back the left side they're holding their wrist is that oh my god oh my god you know what boys you guys need some air support do i need to step in here and help you guys a little bit i'm driving a healthy boys that hellion airs me do not shoot me it's like going all weird oh it's uh it's it's fancy i see them i'm gonna help you guys i'm air supporters here air support is here stop running no he's gonna yes there we go i got another one got another one no they destroyed it i gotta give it to them man this is tough another person on the avengers team is spoon kid the smartest troller and well he did exactly what he was supposed to do yo pick me up pick me up it was short but sweet spoon what was that i'm sorry man come on it's windy today come down get me in give me give me yeah do not throw an f1 grenade you fancy who's among us as the 100 players were getting upgraded gear and weapons the smartest players were coming up with insane strategies to outplay us for example the smartest sniper sinks used wood to build up on a tree so he could snipe with silencers i'm gonna treat break twice not only did he do that but he used the skin box on my server to camo his gear to green so he would be hidden i didn't even know we had skin box on my own server yup this is dangerous behavior dude some guy's gonna come by far my train i'll fall out and die sings wasn't the only one utilizing the trees so was the smartest bow player of pixel something like so where are you at i hear you that's kind of scary i see you come here come here i don't remember no but the smartest solo player belgium was struggling a bit more than the others let's get my hands on one uh uh hey can i get a hand over here you're good yeah william you okay oh thank you man appreciate it what the is this i'm drowning i'm in a cave now in this event we made it so you can't loot dead bodies that way everyone has their own kit and you can't steal from the other team well the smartest players found a way around that i looted one of their arms i'm gonna try and blend in oh you can loot now if you down them and they're still alive you can lose them oh i'm gonna try and get on this all right and soon the rest of the avengers were utilizing this strategy and once again outplayed me on my own server crawl to me don't grow to me bro i got you i got you psych you know what this is actually just a good strat they just don't know anybody bro i'm on your team stop dropping people off you're blending in but this strategy really helped the smartest grub the most considering he was using a db the entire event what's up supply guys some of them are in your kids some of them are in your kids no even with 100 players we could still not cause any damage to that base we needed something to throw the smartest players off their game so i asked my community manager for a little help on the battlefield hey george are you here i am b george send the tank yes sir the tank's coming in boys watch out for that tank oh bradley bradley i'll put the raiders out of all 26 avengers there's only two people that have explosives that can destroy that tank and that would be the smartest raiders in rust they soon realized this was a job that only they could do mark rendezvous to bradley i'm rocking again because he's manhandling you they're both manhandling you right now you're on fire beats orange hey what's good everybody i just wanted to say i hope you all having a great day guys the tank's down i repeat take down tank down i don't know what else to do like i'm checking things off my list i only have a couple more tricks on my sleeve boys you guys can see the leaderboard of who has the most kills let's see who has the most kills right now jesus christ warrior has a 8.24 kdr right now well the reason why warrior had a 8.24 kdr is because the entire event he dampened his discord and didn't say a single thing to his team he honestly just showed up to kill people and it worked warriors devin didn't like j6 just got slammed okay just got slammed slammed but slowly oh he was just like muted deafen controlling lighthouse he also managed to somehow get on lighthouse and it took 20 minutes for the 100 players to finally get him off this is ridiculous i am a sick individual i got you oh my god i'm getting call hold on give me one second guys sir how.gg has given the 100 players air drops and everyone received more explosives and better weapons whoa what's up with these air drops dude it is raining it's raining blue boys get that loot so here we go this is a terrible idea they also gave out 300 worth of ruskins to people in this event so if you're looking to get new ruskins check them out and use code fancy for free 50 cents to start playing we're facing the avengers right do you guys need thanos on the battlefield type 1 if you need thanos on the battlefield i'm coming in yeah in the avengers movie thanos has arrived it's the infinity gauntlet it can't be that strong so we're about to get thanos oh dude they're all coming south foreign now if you're a new viewer to my channel now is a good time to tell you i have an infinity gauntlet in rust that gives me op abilities see that right there that's me launching spood kid 50 feet into the air my soldiers needed help on the battlefield so i barged in with 3 000 hp to see if the smartest first players could defeat thanos foreign are you frozen it's fancy oh fancy go get up betty let's go hold on hold on don't kill me sir he's in black yeah avengers assemble foreign let's go let's go after that there was only one thing left to do soon i'm about to enable one life only mode where everyone on the server will only have one light and if they died they're kicked from the server and whoever's team is the last one standing will win this video this goes for both the 100 players and the smartest players so i won the server in five minutes everyone would have to play for their life are we on one life yet not i think it left like eight minutes or something imagine we all want to be in by the five minutes you already yep one life in like 30 seconds not yet but it will be very soon get ready all right one life boys one life one life only mode was enabled and all of a sudden everyone changed the way they played the avengers played defensively and stuck close to the base while the 100 players kept their distance and was able to rocket the base from far away if they stayed there eventually the base would crumple down but there's one more avenger i haven't introduced yet that's the smartest game sense player stevie and he knew exactly what was happening i think we gotta push out i think we have to push out oh yeah they're just staying way back there dude yeah guys i think we have to push out if we just let them rock it like this and i think it's gonna happen get a few guys together and push out together and come in with uh june there were tons of players rocketing from the right side but only stevie a student album were pushing up to stop them i killed two more here on me alvin you want to push this with me yeah play fast and play passive i'm coming right i'm automatic dude and let's see if any man uh i i can give you something i've been i've been guy 340 guy 340 in the wide open i know i'm done yeah they're pushing me i got you i got you okay okay the avengers knew they couldn't lose age soon or steve because right after alvin one of their best pv peers died soon a lot more followed i died i died you know oh i'm out ggs i'm dead look on the map and help each student stevie boys age room to the left i have a peek on like 15 guys but they keep spraying at me when i pee no i'm down he said four times so you're down she said yeah i'm down i've seen this in the movies it bro i'm pushing oh my god yes i got him i got him i got him let's go you got stevie i'm so happy that he got here oh got up i got up but harvest can you kill h dune harvest will you kill a student come on hey jude where are you oh my god i'm alive no after that we slowly lost control in the smartest players in rust survived with eight members remaining uc on your screen but don't be sad this video is over because if you want to save 100 players can defeat the best clan in rust click this video it's just as good,2022-10-19T18:32:06Z
NuURYHm-8z4,Can 100 Players Defend Against the BEST Clan in Rust?,882793,17810,611,0 days 00:14:06,this is ot the best clan in rust but i wanted to test that they truly are the best so i gather 100 players to see if ot can successfully raid them in the past we've rated ot and they were the ones defending but now the roles are reversed and it's their turn to raid us gentlemen our battle with ot returns today you do not let them on that beach let's go soon we're about to defend a d-day attack from the best clan in ruts but across this water is their territory ot island now here is where ot spawns and they have access to boats helicopters and additional equipment to help them in this raid the ot has three bases to raid and each base gets progressively harder let's go let's go find a position on the beach to hold they're gonna be here soon foreign but if you see someone in diamond armor that's a vip on the 100 players team and they start with full armor and a rifle okay let's go let's go let's go let's go go go go go go go go go go go go go green light green light oh oh my god oh my god dj dj let's go oh my god the war has started the war has started boys we have a solid defense right now boys this is good they're pitched down in the corner as soon as ot landed it was a bloodbath but the 100 players were doing a very good job at holding the sword ot was struggling to get a landing on our beach whoa war never changes wait push right here push me push me you know right me yeah i'm aware in order to get to our first base ot needs to get past the beach believe it or not the first base is our weakest and smallest base of the three but it's still fairly large in size and has plenty of peaks we gotta transport helicopter they're gonna try to go to the sides and we land like behind them i'm landing i'm planning all 100 players merged to the right side of the map but no one realized it was a bait this bait allowed ot members to land on the opposite side of the map and now they were flanking the 100 players from the left alright ot is making a stance they're they're grouping up together they're realizing they have to work together we still have a lot of people spread out but ot is starting to pick you guys off on the beach they're just blowing up people in a car do like 10 guys just blew up that car no ot managed to get past the beach and soon the rating begins in the air all right i i don't know how good this is gonna be but i'm sending it yeah oh damn alerts the first time malloris is going down guys the base is being mlrs all right it's still standing but it took a big chunk and a lot of people died from that all right you know what brawler are you here yes fans down here brolo initiate delta squad right away all right bro look usually we're against each other in my videos but today we need to be on the same page we know what to do listen up delta squad we'll be scuba diving our way over to ot island so we can't be detect once we land on their beach we'll suit up and go behind their barracks to guard the mrs we can't keep letting them air strike our base everyone is counting on us we're gonna swim offward to the right side of the island let's get to know we're gonna take like 30 000 years and as delta squad was moving in we were taking heavy damage on the first base starting to get a raid face down too we waited the bed we're ready to bed in the base they can't respawn we just have to kill them ot destroyed our bed which means the first base has been rated each base has a bed in the core where the 100 players spawn and if ot destroys the bed we can't spawn in it anymore which means the base is considered rated now base 2 is active and it's a lot stronger than the first with a much larger roof and stronger outside defenses the 100 players are also getting an armor upgrade in smgs now things will get a little bit more difficult for ot is foundy wiping the space they are making sure nothing is staying here get ready for phase two boys destroy everything guys come on come on destroying everything let's go while ot was destroying the first base delta squad was moving in alright kitson follow me ot had no idea we were on their island but little did delta squad in brawlow know a random guy named davey gravy was already on the island through the eagles yeah get ready we're going to the top um davey gravy blue delta squad sneak attack and now ot knows we're on their island get these kids to stop shooting oh no just hit him seven times delta squad's mission was a fail oh and if you want to join future 100 player videos join my discord these are open events anyone in my discord can join these recordings in order to get to our next base ot needs to follow a long trail having to deal with 100 players along the way but ot had a strategy going into this first they sent a four squad to sneak through the woods undetected so they could get to the side of our base with no problem next they set an armored bus full of ot members distracting the 100 players on the road the bus was taking a lot of bullets and ot members will drop out behind our men and kill them the rest of ot cleared the roads and sent out helis to wipe out anyone else that was missed ot was using strategy we couldn't keep up with well they're trying to minibop is that is that us or that oh whoa they are trying to minibum because the roof on this base was much larger ot tried landing on top of it but it was nearly impossible as many of the defenders regarding the top meanwhile ots4 squad made it to our base undetected and started building your braid base they're getting your raid base down they're getting your braid bass line look in the forest boys they're starting to get their first raid face down yep they're landing there too yup this is this is where it's gonna be a ton of players merged over to ot's raid base and made it impossible for them to expand we were easily able to use our numbers to keep pressure on ot and keeping them away from our base oh running everyone let's go forward i don't think they're gonna be using that raid base anymore boys ot was struggling with the second base and they were still trying to raid from the roof ass fellas are being planted nothing was working for ot until they came up with a strategy that no one saw coming yeah let's go let's go you've got helis in the sky like waiting tell me are you guys ready cheers make sure you go wide around so they don't insta mini bomb you all right they've mls the their ambler are seeing the base again that that wiped out a lot of people oh they're making an attack on the roof it was a strategic attack boys they're on the road they're pushing in ot launched the mlrs missiles on our base to kill anyone on the roof and strategically timed helicopter landing so they could take control of the roof and because the 100 players left so many doors open this allowed ot to get inside of our base not in the bed are they they might be inside the face someone see foreign boys ot members were inside from the roof invasion and the rest of them were outside rocketing our base we were being raided from both the inside and the out come oh ot rated our second base we lost the bet base two is down it's time to upgrade their kid to the final kick gave everyone full metal a case and mp5s guys this is the final hold they got base two base two is done which means the 100 players get another armor and weapon upgrade these guys finally dispatch it's all open now yeah there's a big hole in the middle of the space second base is down at this point i wasn't sure if we were gonna beat ot i had to pull serious tactics in order to bring this back ot was heading towards the final base but i had a little surprise before they got there server release the beast there's a tornado zone boys i'm locked off what is that now tornadoes don't even exist in rust so this is the first time ot has ever seen one um i would stay away from that drive into it oh my gosh in order to get to our next base ot needs to go through the desert it was a massive battle but ot stuck together at all times and soon arrived to our final base the final base is our strongest one with a full sheet metal base and a giant china wall as an extra layer of defense a roof has multiple layers so ot can land on this one and has plenty of shooting windows bro that's bass is massive let the rockets fly baby take the tower guys take the tower so we can push yeah yeah get the tower get the tower guys get the tower this base proved to be difficult for ot to raid they were forced to use high walls as cover but anytime they try to push up they were instantly melted but a couple members found a secret tunnel that goes under the base wait there's a tunnel over here are you sure about this i mean there's only one way to planned out let's go foreign buddy wrong place wrong time i ot is it emblems is going down i didn't do because this base is strong it did do a little damage but nothing broke so be good we chill yo i think we need some backup something that will give us a little advantage blooming why don't you send in the eagles it will be done ot is making good progress on our final base so it's time to bring in a little air support you see my ammon gloomin has weirdly good piloting skills so we gathered his other pilot friends he calls the eagles and it was their mission to stop ot's raid buzz and i will create an ac-130 formation while everyone else calls that diversion i need to go out there and put bikes behind them with their helicopters okay let's go boys there's no shot that actually worked see what did i tell you man all right let's get to building boys now ot was on the other side of our base undetected they're coming from the front it's a decoy from the beach wait they're on the beach side wait wait guys guys look on the beach side we need some soldiers to look on the b side they're setting up an actual huge raid base on the beach side we need the attention on both sides there it's a pinch they're tacky from both sides moving towards the beach side a lot coming a lot coming bro we put a halt right to that good ship boys see we need that communication wait hold on what what the hell i'm getting a phone call right now hold on uh hello yeah who who's this who am i speaking to go to mario who that says reinforcements this year you can go thank you sir thank you oh my god all right the sponsor of this event hell.gg has given the 100 players reinforcement and everyone received an airdrop oh my god oh my god it's in the air holy crap air jumps are coming down get those airdrops airdrops should be landing on the basin all over holy this is christmas dude they also just messaged me saying a ton of you guys are getting tempered aks so big shout out to how would you do you can also use code fancy at hal.gg for free 50 cents to play for ruskins things were getting down bad for the 100 players and ot broke through our china wall guys they're past that china ball they're making a breach we need people defending everyone be ready for a push everything you ready for a push it we're making perfect progress don't stop we need to open a shadow wall we need to open this thing oh they're on the roof now guys if we don't get control fast this is bad it wasn't looking good and ot was making contact with the main part of our base it was getting bad and we needed some sort of miracle to magically happen festival is here i repeat that support guys look like this what the why is that air force behind us oh yeah yo there's a lot coming look behind you boys oh my god oh my god tremor one hp literally rock the scrappy it's too close if you're in a scrappy land on ot we have ac-130 holy that's best has the m2 this has to be a dog first no after that everything went downhill ot continued heavy damage on our base and eventually was able to get to our bed ot successfully raided all three beds and defeated the 100 players but i have one,2022-10-04T14:37:23Z

the amount of people climbing up at one time i believe almost that was very close you want to come down trust me so i can invite him to team and talk to him without other people knowing him is being formed wow soon the contestants realize they would need to make secret teams to help them in future challenges and obstacles family does not matter in this circle family has never mattered i don't know you how can you be family if i don't know you there's no family we don't believe in family family brock referred to family because in the first circle video everyone was a family until brock

the people here step out of the circle right now or this circle will corrupt you i'm telling you that now i've got to stick with my morals i'm going to stick with being a good person let me get you on

gonna do with the money i'm going to provide clothes and food for my child my seven month old oh they're expensive imagine not pulling out could it be me maybe maybe spend the 300 on condoms next time now from what i've gathered so far these are the current alliances in the circle the bad guys are brock who's the winner of the first circle video and his right-hand man believes i wanted to relive your legend in the first place then we have the good guys who is bad and sunny they're just here for a good time and want nothing but peace then we have everyone else who is neutral they are all on the same team and brawler was able to convince his friend glooman to be an alliance all right everybody are you guys ready for the first elimination challenge everyone comes to the middle for the first elimination challenge i'm bringing in my friend confusion and giving him a bow it's his goal to kill one person in the circle the contestants will each get one wooden barricade to survive this they need to hide and dodge the arrows to avoid death confusion has no idea which contestant is who and he can't get close to the circle guys i don't know if you know about the watchtowers it plays barricades underneath him and you can make it to where he can't even shoot us in brock you think you're smart guys confusion just because you can guess codes doesn't mean you can guess what's going to die shoot me shoot me oh damn hey guys snitch snitch on which one brock is he's the one this one the goalkeeper number one confusion the hunt begins the first person to die is going to be eliminated go ahead confusion and start hunting he has a hundred arrows watch tower yeah i see that hey guys what's going on some contestants were hiding behind the barricades at the bottom and somewhere in the watchtower but i want to point out glooman was using a very smart strategy it would go around the outside of the barricades always staying on the opposite side of confusion this strategy literally makes it impossible for him to get hit blooming also has ten thousand hours in this game he's one of the smartest players i even know oh you're a headshot man oh someone got hit up at the top hey guys someone got hit again brock went down but his teammate believe picked him up oh my god i can see it oh my god and his teammate picks him up but despite believes effort it did not matter who do you think out of all those people in the circle is going to be the person to win this challenge i hope believer glue wins little does the rest of that circle know is glues insiding a group right now my legacy would live on is all i care about so that was the first person eliminated how are we going dethroned i bet the leaves having a little bit of a cry right now we're okay we're okay we're gonna we're gonna be all right after that interview i learned that glooman told brock he plans to betray his group at some point even betray his own best friend brawlo all right everyone after every elimination you all get a new item so line up high stone gate please we got a high external wooden gate can i get a recycler please all right boom would get a stone gate a chippy arcade machine i'll take a wood gate i'll keep your arcade machine the reason why most of these contestants are choosing high wood and stone gates is so they can recycle it for resources to build in the circle guys don't don't destroy vaz's item this time man all right let let them please don't i can't place it you have to place on a wooden foundation so maybe someone can place it for you or build it build a foundation somebody make foundation for us we just want to have fun see everyone else is strictly business choosing walls and other things that'll help them and then the two people that want to have fun can you upgrade it max lemme thank you if anyone blows up this foundation there is no more brock there's no beliefs don't do that don't do it please this is for my fallen friends now that brock was eliminated who was the biggest villain in the circle his teammate believe was here to fulfill his legacy and tortured the group as much as he could but luckily barlow and gloomen were able to save the arcade machines i believe is the new villain of the circle believe you wasted that c4 dude how does that feel i'm so glad perfectly fine there's no more explosives in the circle everyone can have peace now do you want to look next to the recycler guys three workbench take a look at the tier three this is a symbol this is a symbol oh after i'm done what did i believe he took the skull that i put on the skull trophy you will never display my fallen friend like that what's going on and he would have betrayed you but then a new villain was starting to rise max stole bazz and studies arcade machines and recycled them for his own resources yeah i had to man they were having too much fun i ever tried it it would be the last actually happening man max i am so proud of you right why would you want to take away people's funds because you're having too much fun in italy you want anything anything good three now someone secretly stole a tier three workbench and the group can't craft high tier items anymore in round two of the circle things were getting hectic and people were playing dirty probably max he's a villain max you are evil the first item you chose was a piano second one was a chippy and both have been destroyed how are you feeling right now man um not so good no fun anymore to brighten things up i offer to the group if they can headshot an npc outside of the circle with a bow i'd give them christmas lights to add a little sparkle to the circle but if they'd miss it i'd take the recycler it made things even worse because brawler missed the headshot and now the group lost their recycler round two was a depressing round for the circle but with that being said let's get right into the second elimination challenge there's two npcs and the players can choose which one to kill if they kill the closer npc they are safe from elimination but if they kill the farther npc they're both safe and they get a bonus item after the challenge and if you miss your shot you're out of the circle but check this out in the background you can see koala plays the tier 3 workbench down which means he stole it from earlier and he used it to craft a compound bow a much easier bow to shoot the npcs with if you guys didn't see he crafted a compound though he stole the workbench from earlier and used it to craft an advantage for this challenge i'm going for the far one oh my god and he just headshots it instantly db gets the headshot is safe and gets an extra item a compound bow gloomin hits it it's just too easy it is just too easy bez hits it insane bralo hits a head shot clean he gets a head shot believe hits the headshots it was now down to sunny if she hits the target we go to overtime but if she misses she is eliminated all right take your shoulders don't miss believe me take some water i have the worm if you need to throw up at someone alright sonny you may now walk out of the circle goodbye sunny has been eliminated but out of all those people in the circle who do you think is going to win i hope bass is gonna win i really hope bass is gonna win he deserves it he's a good kid all right everyone that is the second person eliminated how you guys feeling after that oh great amazing you guys are all man all right anyways line up plus two items two high external wooden gates can i have two high external stone gates one stone and one wood gate i'll take a wood gate and a recycler i'll do two stone gates i would like one c4 please all right the challenge is back on here we go so bes your only friend that was in the circle is now eliminated how are you feeling right now no very nice good oh whoa whoa whoa oh whoa oh no oh my god leave me leave me guys what is wrong with you guys oh man you always need to be paying attention in the circle because some players trapped bads into a one by one after he was not paying attention and has placed the pookie bears in sonny's memory this round the circle was changing now that people have resources to build it seems like these players were saving up for a few rounds and now they're executing a plan they've had oh my god there's a lot of building going on seems like people are working together here why are you trapping me here this is competition what can i say oh my god glooven gloomin's changing too this circle is changing everybody this circle really changes into the worst man hey we we we have friends we have friends i think this is the first time there's more villains in the circle than good people what is this circle coming to please let me out oh mel blue use the c4 this can be your good character arc believe is the only person that can let bads out because he has the only explosive which is a c4 in the circle eventually bass will be light out for the elimination challenge but until then he has 45 minutes left being stuck in this one by one yes he'll be in there for an hour believe yes beth can we make an alliance or something well i don't know if you're on a team of belief that's that's dangerous i mean hey if you're if you're welcome if you're willing to join the dark side i'm always down because i'm sorry you gotta go with this but you won't be in there forever when we do our next elimination challenge you'll be tp'ed out just saying you're just wasting your stuff i'm getting exactly exactly tell them buzz yeah you're a loser everything was common people were just building and i was checking emails until this happened you dare me do it right now right now right now do it oh watchtower's gone oh and you didn't let me out god no i didn't let you out you all i gotta say is no one can ever dare me and think i won't follow through flash back to the last episode brawler's three hours will see forward and it happened once again the circle repeats itself multiple times he's gonna have to watch his back that's all i'm gonna say it was time to do the next elimination challenge and each contestant will be high above the circle standing on a stone frame it's simple the first person to fall off will be eliminated you can push people off by standing on their heads or you could play defensively by crouching around oh yeah without these items yeah if you have if you have items but there's no building oh it has to be it has to be a stone frame oh my god a smoke grenade oh my god i'm washing to see if anyone falls now would be the time to push someone now is that your tactical advantage i don't know where i'm facing i don't know where everyone is go to the sound go to the sound of the battle scared boys max has fallen oh my god unfortunately you're the only one to fall it's time for you to leave the circle get out of here max has been eliminated let's go get your interview say goodbye to the group have everyone in that circle who do you think is the one person that's going to win this challenge i have to say bravo the a team over here that is the third person eliminated from the circle how are we feeling guys that one kind of hurt really after all the things he did he did some bad things in the circle man yeah that's why i'm kind of hurt all right you guys know what time it is lineup we're gonna do items since we're in round four i'm giving the contestants an option like normal they can choose an item they want or they can remove an item from the circle now i would like you to remove the recycler i knew it wow as the request the recycler has been removed all right add that back oh yo on this wall right now there we go that's fine tier three windmill um c4 i want a saw i wanna saw round four started now let's see how the circle will play out with one less villain i just believed in our recycler he's locked in our room oh okay please done i plan to put myself in here i want it to be in here that means no one else can access the recycler believe was stuck in db's room with the recycler but the players realized the recycler slightly pokes through the wall on the other side so they could use it without opening the door oh my god oh no way in case we need to use it now believe was the person who was stuck for the rest of the round a little circle karma for not helping bazz out earlier when he was stuck in his one by one and what's even funnier is now baz has a c4 and has the option to blow believe out but baz is smart enough not to do that baz could blow you out and bass could start forming a relationship and maybe a teammate no thank you i don't need him too oh no okay he wouldn't have chosen well he wouldn't blow you up as so you don't blow him out yeah yep after that the circle was becoming hopeful the rest of the players were working together and decorating their new home and playing music bass was accepted into the group i believe was salty stuck in the room next to them looks like everyone's surviving back to normally there seems to be a community like i hear pianos i hear cowbells but the circle was getting a little too friendly i had to make sure these contestants were facing a challenge so i spawned a scientist near the circle uh oh what the hell what's that let's go there show me what fancy you up to now what's that guys wow oh someone's just being annoying is that believe of course eventually he'll stop right guys you test me i'll give you a full set of role-player things so couches a table some chairs oh dude yeah a hundred percent kids what are we getting rid of though but if you fail the recycler's gone okay that's fine that's fine yeah let's do it let's do it let's do it all right yeah yeah i believe if they would let you out would you agree no because i could have left a long time ago when db opened the door but i chose not to we gotta get this guy out of here oh man oh that's wholesome oh koala what the hell man come on what the hell man fez is your team now why why are you doing that sonny wasn't oh my god voila i'm gonna die another 30 minutes went by in the circle it was time to do the fourth illumination challenge i will give you 60 seconds i need all of you guys to choose a teammate and choose wisely db i see yes guys oh wait cheers i guess believe i'm here i'm going to count with you as well man this team join my team bruh oh whoa whoa what just happened for this challenge the players needed a team but gloom and brallow bass and db didn't team with koala forcing him to team with the villain believe koala was always the one left behind on the team and was clearly on the bottom and the signs were so obvious throughout this challenge can i come in please please i'm trying to vibe in there i want to get no one gave me a key bro koala what the hell man that's what my team believe they keep casting me out moving me out of everything bro koala decided to team with believe because this entire time he didn't feel like he fit with the group koala threw his teammates right under the bus because they didn't want to team with him for this challenge but i told the group to choose their partners very carefully i hope you chose your partner very carefully because in this challenge you will be killing your partner what oh my god of course i have the partner the most hours for this challenge the contestants need to kill their opponents they thought they'd be teaming up for a challenge so they chose their closest allies but it ended up being the opposite to win this challenge be the first person to kill your opponent within a yoka let the best rng win yeah best of luck to you man best of luck to you as well man we had a good friendship we made a good hut no hard feelings man even though we've been on opposite sides of this whole struggle i think you're misunderstood and if you beat me best of luck to you best of luck to you i appreciate it i'm shooting my shotgun in the air and once you hear that that means kill your opponent here we go no oh my you cheated and i beat you bruh oh god all right so i'm gonna ask one at a time believe have all those people in the circle who do you think is going to win bloomin i sing voila i think brawler deserves it he uh he fumbled it last time but i think he deserves this one it is now down to three people all of a sudden we went from six to three how is everybody feeling after that terrible horrible hey you didn't have to put down beds all right gloomin has the most guilt here look at bazza's body right here look at it all right but you guys know what time it is it's time to do items can i get a test generator i won i saw her again i want a tier three there we go guys other rounds i i don't wanna i don't want these guys to be my enemies you know what i somehow knew it would be us three at the end i will say the strongest players have made it to the end here the ones with the most hours the smartest players in this challenge have made it to the final three blumen has outplayed every challenge like how we saw him going around the wooden barricades in the first elimination and using his smoke grenade to his advantage to win the third challenge koala was also smart to craft compound bows in the second challenge and also has over 7 000 hours helping him get to the final three and then we have brollo he knows the circle inside and out making it to the final two in the last circle video and somehow makes it to the final three in this one these three all wanted to win and they are playing their hardest but only one will win the three hundred dollars these three players were maturing and showing respect to their fallen comrades by placing damn pookie bears in honor of baz and sunny and school trophies for believe in db koala let's start with you who do you think is the biggest threat in the circle right now that's me baby all right brawler what about you i'm gonna have to say the same thing it's me oh my god and gloomin what do you think i think the biggest threat here is betrayal little does the rest of that circle know is glue's insiding a group right now that's deep oh yeah wait a second i think we're like uh we're like a family pack of wolves right now we're all very dangerous but if one of us dies they're getting eaten fast recycle everything you're worth in celebration for the players making it to final three we made at night and laid off some fireworks final three but another 40 minutes went by and it was time to do the next elimination challenge all right guys we may all be friends now but i think it's time for this next elimination challenge are you guys ready yes uh no matter what boys i love you 255 minutes it's the wheel bruh it's a wheel that may not be the it's the wheel oh no it wouldn't be a circle video without the iconic circle wheel deciding the fate of one player the wheel challenge is a tradition in the circle series and it decides who is least worthy of being in the circle it's very simple whoever the wheel lands on is eliminated do you guys want to say anything before i spin this been nice boys it's been a good ride been a good ride i'm gonna ask for better brothers spin that wheel oh my god oh you made my house so awesome the wheel has spoken today and it is your time to step up has been eliminated let's go get your interview it was a good time everyone deserves it there and i couldn't have uh fought better people to end it with final two people who do you think is going to win this challenge it's gonna have to go brawler you think it's this term they they both deserve it but a big brother we are down to our final two players boys come to the front god can i tell you something if it had been me and gloom in the last two would have been like a band of brothers like going to the end yeah like i said i think it's just meant to be best luck to you as well you know i hate to hate to go against you on this but i have to redeem myself brawler knows what he needs to do oh i'm happy you're here with me i think i got this one in a bag koala is the reason why you might be here brother cause he did give you that compound though call if you didn't do that it might be someone else right here final items i'll let you guys choose two which two items would you guys like i want a tombstone that is a respectable brother right there and i want another tombstone for max for my first item can i get a gravestone my second item can i get a instant camera so i can document all the fun times we have what is this uh gravestone for i kind of always liked baz he was a good kid oh man you guys did have your differences he didn't really like you he wanted to kill you voila we're gonna die at the end of the day you're the bigger man three two one go i just i'm really screenshotting that right now yeah these two were not leaving the circle anytime soon they've been through so much and you could feel the suspense in the circle between the both of them for the final elimination challenge i needed the circle to be cleared so i thought it would be proper to give these two rocket launchers to destroy their very own creation they've been building for the last six hours i agree i agree all right you guys may destroy the thing you built up for the past six hours now there's only two people and every time there's a 1v1 situation in my videos we will always do a wild west 1v1 the final elimination challenge is a wild west 1v1 each contestant will be turned around and when they hear my shot they must kill their opponent brawlo is here to redeem himself from the last circle video he has made it to the final two once again and is one challenge away from completing his journey the only person standing in his path is the underdog koala koala was the one who helped brawl in the bow challenge by giving him a compound bow yet was always left out of his group there is no more group now and it's just man to man they both have about the same amount of hours so this is as fair as it gets bravo here's yours 300 is on the line i think it's more than three hundred dollars for brella here this is just my dignity man everything is on the line for you i'm the underdog boy gentlemen do you have any final words to each other a nice partner best of luck to you gentlemen take three steps forward when you hear my python shoot in the air you will turn around and kill your opponents here we go i my gun did not shoot thumbs down oh my god koala is the winner of the third circle video and received his reward and i know many of you are disappointed bralla didn't win so comment down below if you think he should get one more shot in the next circle video and if you want to be the next circle video join my discord because all the contestants today were chosen from my discord,2022-09-14T14:38:18Z
TY8mOunVLSY,Can 200 Players Defeat the BEST PvPers in Rust?,540475,11713,460,0 days 00:12:23,these are the best pvpers in rust just between the three of them they have a total of 43 000 hours in this game these guys are absolutely insane at pvp but i wanted to see if 200 players could work together to defeat them i put these pvpers in a deadly arena for example i pressed this button and it electrocutes everyone in the arena and slowly i'll be bringing in waves of players to see if we can defeat them we're going to be using every strategy in the book to see if the best pvpers could be defeated let's see if 10 players could defeat the pvpers you guys are going to die so are you guys ready to sacrifice even though there's no chance of them winning these 10 players were motivated to fight throw your rock worse open the gates i'm feeling so bummed now let's double the amount of players entering the arena are you guys ready yeah yeah all right yeah open the gates all over this arena are landmines so you're about to see a lot of people blow up today oh god oh you guys got some hits on things that's that's huge and one guy just ran into the barricade very nice and i forgot to mention i have multiple traps in this arena that miami blooming will be activating throughout this video and all he has to do is flip a switch now we're adding 30 players but utilizing all three gates so players can flank the pvpers on the sides the players were starting to realize they need to work together if they're going to defeat these pvpers but 30 players were no match for them now it's time to bring in more players and this time 50 players are entering the arena there's 50 of you we can do this we can kill one person in there baby peers are you guys ready how how concerned are you for this round i'm kind of concerned with things because he's a good thrower you did step on a land my last round i mean posey might be right here even though there were 50 of them it literally looked like a battlefield with them hiding behind barriers and picking up their fallen brothers pick each other up once you get behind that first ball 50 players were no match for the pvp so now it's time to switch things up this time we're bringing in 60 players but giving them riot shield the players can create a formation like spartans to get closer to the pvpers but the 60 players took things in their own hands women open the gates the 60 players rose together and refused to step outside into the arena guys hold w go go go they had impenetratable riot shields and decided to hold their ground instead of pushing up so i decided to give the pvpers grenades if they're not gonna move we'll make them move yep thank you you guys better start moving he's gonna grenade you you better move move wait like hit the gate oh it's like minus four but that grenade was enough to scare the other players and eventually they all died now it's time to bring in 100 players into this arena and all gates will be used oh and if you want to join future videos like these join my discord these are open events anyone is allowed to join these videos alright boys charge go go go go go there's numbers now we have numbers we also had an illegal item now i don't know how but one of the players found a contraband weapon and got an ak with the few bullets left he must have found it from the last round and hid it somewhere but it caught the pv piers off guard what it was now down to six and he was holding his position i'm not moving bro i'm not moving from this frog everyone hold w at that rock he's that there's already people here he's distracted everyone go go go hold w go charge let's go let's go now technically we won that round but someone had an ak so i don't count it most of these players were being instantly killed and unable to even reach the best pvp and because of this motivation was pretty low but a new leader was starting to form amongst the players we need a few of us to flank around the edge we need to organize and send people across each angle so they can't they can't look in every direction with our numbers we will be victorious now it's time to bring in 150 players oh my lord oh my gosh come get me come get me the hell no you come to me i'll die before that come on another switch on the panel is we control the barricade but emma gloom and decided to be a little evil and remove their cover hey yo what the there goes on the coffer go go go go go everyone at once they can't kill you all but eventually the pvpers killed all the players don't kill me don't do it don't do you should revive me the main problem we're having is people group up and don't push in together so i decided to lead the players on this one what we're going to do is we're going to do a full charge as soon as those gates open oh i see a poster moving now obviously pretty as soon as those gates open everyone hold w in charge of the shots now it's time to bring in all 200 players and since we've hit our player limit each round the 200 players will get a special item to help defeat the best pvpers this round they'll get hazmat suits so they can take a few bullets before dying oh my god there's so many oh and the big pool in the middle is what we call the fish pond when someone falls in it's impossible to get out so they become a little fishy now amid all this chaos there was not one but two spin butters that got into the event and we're going crazy with the rock let's hear it by the chia please eventually the spin butters were banned even with not intentionally having two spin butters in the arena the 200 players still cannot defeat the pvpers now it's time to heavily upgrade their armor the 200 players will have heavy armor suits so now they're moving tanks taunted uh posty and sinks i have a question for you guys so every content creator i bring in my videos i give them something called the mama test do you guys happen to know what that is that is a few times i think well the mama test is where you give us your best and we score at one out of ten are you up for the challenge yeah i'll let i'll let post to go first oh man i'd say that's a 7.5 all right taunted mama oh that's a knife that is something help me up help me up someone help me up thank you help me get out of it they're all in the wrong voice chase them boys guys you've lost your momentum we really did oh boys at this point just hold w bend over you must go yeah let's clean up at this point one thing we did accomplish though is feeding our new human shirt we can talk about it that round showed us we don't need extra defense we need more often so the 200 players will now be getting bone knives the pvpeers were using spiked beer case so the players couldn't reach them oh even though we couldn't reach them with our knives we could still throw them guys throw your bow knives at that person at the top you were the last one alive guys there's one more shooter get on boys go go go go oh dude ain't no way one of the deadly switches opens the sarlacc pit and gloomin found a perfect opportunity to activate it there's too many of a man oh my god after many rounds the 200 players were finally victorious but what happens if we did one more random we gave them an op weapon let's see what happens when we give them flamethrowers that flamethrower has range too don't underestimate that flamethrower i don't know about this one i can't see the voice each pvper's youtube is linked below if you want to watch more of them and if you want to see if 100 players can defeat the best clan in russ click the video on your screen,2022-08-22T14:51:42Z

now all right all right send something meteors go go go go go we gotta keep going we gotta keep going at this point the server was starting to find out where we were and we had no choice but to run a few grids away is our evacuation pilot but we were being attacked from all angles let's go let's go keep it moving keep it moving no we need to keep moving keep moving lend us down here let's go after that attack we lost four people two farmers db the stunt double in bells fancy herb the meteors were a success brawl's hq is under attack very good before we were ambushed i made a call to the server owner to send meteors at brallo's hq guys there's like a bunch of meters coming down what the hell they're bombing they're about with hq seek shelter and speaking of meteors i should let you know that i have a rust natural disaster server it's a tedx server where natural disasters occur around the map like tornadoes thunderstorms nukes and meteors oh my god search fancy over under the mounted section to find my server everybody let's go let's go let's go keep it moving guys we don't want to stay in one place it's surrounding us fancy there's still a couple behind at this point our cover

close by let's go let's go a few grids away is our secret bunker from earlier this is the only safe option we have left to go we left one behind he's he's gonna make it back don't worry do not say

A4j6v2hTrfc,"Rust, but NATURAL DISASTERS Happen Every 5 Minutes",241526,6323,179,0 days 00:09:50,we made it so natural disasters happen every five minutes natural disasters don't exist in rush but today that changes i invited 70 of my discord members and on this map different disasters will occur it'll create a red circle zone where the natural disaster is happening and every one minute you're in that zone you gain three points and every person you kill in the server equals one point the person with the most points wins this challenge so everyone loaded in to prepare for what was about to come my teammates were already farming but i forgot to change my steam name so some people found me before the challenge even started my teammates today are my admins brawlo and gloomin alongside with confusion and koala all right is this you guys i'm here hello hello oh we got plenty of guns okay yeah where do we want to build now on the server barrels give really good items so we have insane pvp moments in the natural disaster zones yeah they call me the stallion no one calls you that buddy you're not that guy you're not that guy the server had a short grace period so everyone could gather weapons before the natural disasters start happening but some people couldn't understand that concept oh there's a grace period you dumbass now in this challenge points are individual based you can still team with people but your points aren't shared some people decided to work in groups but others didn't get along so well oh this is my toolbox a little let's go give it a scope no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no give me the scope yeah give give me a chest plate chest plate huh i have 25 rockets i can half my no no i don't need those rockets i mean you too but we decided to get our base down but the problem we realized is we didn't have enough time to build a base because as we were building the first disaster was about to happen right next to us oh my god oh my god oh my god the first disaster are tornadoes if you get too close to them they'll push you back and they also shoot rockets which can kill you we get three points every one minute for staying in this tornado zone also in these zones airdrops will spawn for extra loot we need to be in the zone to get points into the eye of the storm go go go go we're going in we're going all right guys work together work around the zone around the zone stay away from those tornadoes because they're shooting rockets i don't know if you guys noticed east they're east they're east oh my god the tornado's pushing me no no no no the tornado killed me the tornado's oh my god oh my god but we weren't the only ones struggling with tornadoes let's check in on the other players i just got l nines oh oh my god these guys are bad these are my viewers oh my god oh dude my trees are going down dude dude the tornadoes blowing my cover tornado just blew down all my trees like i have no cover now the first disaster ended and i was on top of the leaderboard oh fast you just passed me on the leaderboard oh my god i'm dominating the leaderboard let's go now if you're watching this and you also want to play natural disasters in russ my 10x natural disaster surfer is now open it's exactly what you see in this video where natural disaster zones will happen every 30 minutes and like you just saw these zones are always filled with pvp since these zones spawn with loot search fancy orb under the modded section and you'll find my server but the next disaster was about to happen meteor strikes oh my god the meteors dude these meteors will instantly kill you if it lays near you and they will sometimes spawn with loot crates now we didn't control that zone as much so we need to prepare for the next disaster let's group up together boys all right let's let's recoup and get together right we lost the leaderboard after that one we group up together now and we roam together boys there's no more losing here okay all right boys all right we got our control we got guns you guys ready to do this yep let's roam let's roam a little the next disaster was an earthquake on top of a mountain the earthquake disaster makes your screen shake so it's very difficult to aim at enemies move together boys we're a pack of wolves have some cloth i don't got any cloth any coffee bags no clothes no nothing oh my god i got the most nastiest clip we discovered that riding a horse didn't make your screen shake but unfortunately oh my i died but confusion went beast mode during the earthquake i shot him dead oh my god oh behind my head what i'm down you're good you're good oh my god dude we are racking up these points bro the earthquake disaster ended and next was the thunderstorm the entire sky changes and you can't see far away this allows for a ton of people to get in the disaster zone oh oh my god this is so cool i love this one yeah this one's way better than the chest earthquake in the bushes oh my just doubled someone no what's this fight is happening not even nice oh we're all still on the leaderboard the thunder disaster ended but the next disaster was going to be different instead of a zone being formed the disaster was going to be server wide water will rise and the map will start to flood we got it we got no water's rising guys but some people weren't so worried about the water rising it's part of the pool party come in oh wait red the show is that be red was in h5 which was the tallest point on the map but we were able to get to h5 because soon a double disaster was about to happen right the water it's the pool is it getting hard to breathe but it ruined the pool party the beach all the beach is gone naked grubs oh my god oh no please let's go everyone group up back at the base everybody ready yep we're ready tornadoes with flood uh oh my god all right let's push in boys let's go let's go let's go all right wait would that thing like suck you up yeah you're gonna get stuck oh let's go oh my god go go go go run run dude it's taking me everywhere dude okay yeah that rocket was really close i should probably back down so many bricks there's like a little island where we built our basement no i'm moving further the water and tornadoes cleared and it was time for the final disaster which was meteor strikes the meteors were happening at the exact same spot we tried to build our base at the beginning of this challenge we were going to finish right where we started oh just hold the jump up hold it jump up just hold oh my the challenge ended and this is the top 10 leaderboard

EciprN7gTcI,Can 200 Rust Players Defeat an ARMY of Admins?,1126523,19660,853,0 days 00:19:48,this is my army of admin abusers and i wanted to see if 200 players can work together to defeat us it's the admins goal to hunt down every single player on this map and everyone only has one life so if you get killed you're kicked and eliminated from the server so on the 200 players team is the good admin brawler and it's his goal to protect and help the 200 players survive he's allowed to do anything in his admin abilities to help defeat us the hunt begins kill every single person you see out there boys do me proud boys do me proud every admin has blackout armor and they have 500 hp there are also three boss admins and they're in diamond armor they have 1000 hp and then there's me the final boss admin with 10 000 hp and all the admins have unlimited rockets voila are you ready my friends this is koala and he's the best minicopter pilot in rust he has 2 000 hours alone just practicing the mini copter and he'll be my personal pilot throughout this video oh no oh my you're not going to crash this right we only have one life whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa dude that was really risky you only have one life so you cannot crash here there's a car there's a car oh i'm jumping down i got you koala i got you oh my god where are my frames going oh my god that's why come on come on run run oh my god get out get out get out evans reported f9 there's a big face i was wondering why my frames were going down all of a sudden because that massive base was loading in what the brawlo helped the 200 players build a giant capital which was their main defending point 75 percent of the players are located just in this area and some of the admins already started on the attack all right admins uh got an issue on our hands well let's get this out of here pick me up man meanwhile koala and i decided it would be better to pick off the smaller bases the hunt just started so it wouldn't be wise to attack the biggest strong point so we traveled around looking for some stragglers oh wait what is this wait we could actually check this out koala lay me on the roof let me oh my god guys let's fall back a little let's fall back a little we got to keep you protected too oh a guy i'll never let me over here let me over here one's dead one's dead oh we just shot up a disco party dude damn it man let's go around and we'll sneak up on foot so they can't hear us let's go the ice lake base was our first target and they were putting up a good fight we got reinforcements come to g5 oh we got another squad pushing into g5 m is if you guys can get the g5 come to g5 and with that call of help all admins in the area showed up to this space yeah yeah do it quick nice nice nice oh kyle and nathan to the rescue let's go reinforcements right here next system out to you keep rocking that wall all right let's see for the store here we go oh this is us oh this is us all right all right we wiped them out good boys that's it after raiding that base it really showed us that the admins work together as a team let that be a warning to everyone else on the server if you don't join the capital you're gonna end up like g5 but the capital was our next target it was time to start the capital raider koala you're with me let's go get your ass to the capitol right now i want every single player dead is that understood yes sir if that rocket hits you we're dead oh my god back up back up get in the helicopter get in the helicopter get in get in get oh in god they're getting out they're escaping they're escorting people out all atmos begin to push in this capital will be ours i want control this entire capital admins the capital has been defeated there is no more capital man the capital has been defeated everyone spread out and find the remaining people after the massive capital raid the 200 players now had 59 people left brawler was able to rescue players to safety but now all we have to do is hunt down the survivors all right koala you're with me still everyone spread out let's go we're gonna find the remaining people oh and if you want to join future 200 player videos join my discord these are open events anyone in my discord can join these recordings oh get that guy all right i'm dropping good good good awesome okay good job my man let's go they're all holding up at lighthouse lighthouse is their new stronghold oh they're at lighthouse all right let's go let's go lighthouse we'll see you there be careful my friends it's dangerous there was rumors that some of the players escaped to the nearby lighthouse they got stonewalled at the top lighthouse got cleared we'll make sure of that oh my god we're going upside down okay i see only see dead bodies i think they really did clear it there's still 53 people they weren't at lighthouse they're somewhere else they're somewhere else we haven't found them here guys they weren't at lighthouse there was a few players at the lighthouse but this wasn't where the main group was so the admin scanned the entire map while i led a group to oil rig to see if this is where the survivors were located i don't think this is where there would be a lot more shooting if they were all here i still don't think this is where they all are but yet again only a couple survivors were on oil rig after the capital purge it seemed like the 50 players were scared they realized the true power of the admins and they lost all motivation to fight after seeing their brothers being murdered at the capitol brawler went around the map and everyone was playing for their own survival instead of working together as our search continued around the map it allowed us to get easy kills since people avoided working in big groups but it was brallow's job to not give up on these players instead he gave them hope we negotiated and it was fair to make the admins health at 100 instead of 500 now this is an even playing field but at this point it was 30 admins to 20 players we still had the upper hand if someone tells me the location of where the 25 remaining people are at right now i will give you a skin c9 okay go to c9 all harbor okay they're all at harbor all admins move to the harbor and c9 steven asks if this is true you're getting a skin this is what you get for selling us out what the welcome to the welcome to the hell zone bro you sell us out we'll sell you out oh that's what you that's what you get for snitching oh yep they're here let's go oh my god i'm stuck i'm stuck all i have is come to c9 they're in the scene and block off the trade tunnels start to fight them guys we need to control the trains oh my god oh uh yeah i need help guys i'm kind of stuck i can try i can try and get you no no no i got a tv all right everybody move everybody move wait i can't get in i can't get in i can't proceed i can't press it you guys have to break this okay i'm up i'm up i'm up all right we're good we're good we're good let's push down admins let's push down let's go let's go alright koala are you down here with me he's dead no he died he died how did he die when koala was trying to rescue me at the stairs someone accidentally see fortis heli and he died i lost my minicopter pilot can anyone here drive a mini copter uh i can drive him in the tunnels all right tv you're with me you're my new pilot now i guess go sparrow stop standing there do something let's fight these people let's go go go go someone better have a report on brawl we're losing too many people they're starting to get the upper hand now how is this happening gotta keep spreading out all admins keep gathering intel and put it in the team chat oh brawler just gave everyone metal frags they're definitely building something guys they're building a new capital he just gave everyone metal frags guys guys we need to build something up here we need to build something up but the admins found where the remaining players were located oh my god i think we found it have we found it bye bye fly by uh they're shooting hv oh my god we found them we found them boys brala knew they couldn't hold that iceberg forever so once again they were on the run go go boys go call the helicopters going somewhere follow the helicopter you follow that and yup there's people in it no what tv please i got you what happened i don't know i think brawler might have broken it it's editing this video i am so sorry i don't even know if i can do that but i had to they're in that helicopter at launch site brawler was taking the remaining players to the top of launch site for the last stand we had them pinned down with nowhere else to leave but we didn't realize we were walking right into brawlow's trap yep there they are they're on top they're on top of main building main building they're on top of main building land is leaving lando's land is like all admins top of launch top of launch are holding up there guys this is this is where the last stand has to be keep it up boys i'm gonna give you some meds stand back stand back i'm gonna give some meds the surviving players had the high ground on us and the admins couldn't push in because brawler spawned 10 tanks guarding the main building but since db and i got to launch site first i was the only one able to sneak into the building oh what's fainting doing up there making my way up the stairs i listen to my brothers being murdered outside play come in here come in here oh no claim died i'm dead no i couldn't go fast either because brawler placed landmines on the stairs everyone was counting on me to get to the top before we lose our entire army i killed another one man i killed another one i'm clapping these bro admins i'm at the top i'm at the top emma's i'm killing them all i'm killing them all ammons i'm at the top everyone push up everyone push up they're distracted on me where's my admin oh my god i'm down to eight admins they got stamp sites they got stamp sites no that was close i'm at the top i'm at the top kill another kill another get up here admins got another gun another they're on the run i see their little feats i see their little feet that was the turning point of this battle brawler was able to escape with the remaining players but now there are more players than admins who do we have left boys did we lose two boss admins kyle i don't see it man there's eight of them left and there's seven of us i have 1900 hp remaining i'm not looking too hot we only travel together from now on okay there's no separating can we get one last ou for our fallen brothers three two one the seven remaining players with bravo you guys don't wanna type a chat you don't wanna reveal yourself come on type in the game chat i just wanna see who it is you never know there could be a big prize on the line which one of you boys wants to snitch you must be brawlow's loyal soldiers if you're not going to snitch sorry fancy but i don't think they're going to snitch d1 now is that a troll because d1 is in lighthouse you're at the lighthouse you know what we're gonna do one more thing before we go you guys probably think you can hide all over the map don't you you guys think you have the whole map to yourself because there's only eight of us well uh you might want to get us in the air for this uh diamond so why don't you fly us up lava is on the server now and it will slowly start to rise until there is literally nowhere for you to hide i can use natural disasters like lava to my advantage so there are fewer places to hide i'm also doing this because my rust natural disaster server is now open it's a 10x rust server with natural disaster zones so you'll see things like tornadoes meteor strikes thunderstorms and more that all drop extra loot if you go to these zones search fancy orb under the modded section and you'll find our server oh my god oh my god diamond what's going on man are you good jesus christ how did we lose one from that oh my god god damn it guys how are you letting this happen yeah fancy yes i think we're ready for you to push us all right tell me where you are and i will stop the lava you know when we said that we were at a lighthouse we weren't lying yep there is they're out there they're southwest land below land below they're in that very top part that's the only place they can be should we try a scrappy do you think that's our best option we'd have to fly over and drop it off because they're just gonna hold that spot we can't walk over we have to fly over the remaining players were holding lighthouse but because of the lava we couldn't just run up to them we have no idea what's over there because it's too far away to tell so instead of us all pushing at once we need to go one at a time you know i need two of you brave men to go on a mission all right all right video who who will go with him s and far will you go with him i nominate s and far you can do this gentleman do it for all your fallen brothers i'll try to keep it as steady as possible there they go we won't know what happened to them until we see the number down we got this oh oh oh my god oh no no i think you're you know the planes plug-in that we used in the ot video in my last video 100 players fought the best clan and rust and planes were used in that battle we know that brawler has same size at that lighthouse but since they're custom planes we weren't sure if they were targeted kyle here is the only one who knows how to drive it and they have rockets in them which you can use to shoot down the surviving players yeah you're the best pilots that could ever drive those you've practiced so many hours kyle we don't have any other options kyle you could be the next sacrifice you realize what we have to do right okay i'll be the next sacrifice oh before you go yeah it was great serving with you soldier oh oh oh wish me luck bring it home kyle come on kyle behind you behind you guys oh he's gonna crash diamond it's just us man nothing was working i didn't want to have to do it in this video but i have no other option hold on i still have one more weapon i'm bringing out my infinity gauntlets in the last admin abuse videos where you first saw the gauntlet in action i can spawn meteors freeze players and a ton of other op features but more importantly i have a shield that protects me from bullets and rockets and i wanted to test if it would protect me from the lava just one final thing i need to test i'm not taking damage i'm not taking damage the shield protects me from lava so here's the plan before kyle died we spawned cars to see if lava would damage us and it didn't good news boys good news diamond kid is going to be geared up with heavy armor and drive across the lava since he won't take damage and once we arrive at the lighthouse i'm jumping out and activating the shield and from there will kill the remaining players i have no idea if this is even gonna work but it is literally our only option this is for all of our fallen brothers we have to do this for them if we don't make it out of this it was an honor serving with you let's go here we go diamond i never would have thought we'd be driving a lava and rust but today's that day for the boys wait what is that they're on a car wait they're in a car fire go go disperse disperse this first it's working time it's working stay alive diamond headshot headshot diamond i'm pushing in hello boys he's coming up he's coming up he's coming up now wherever you are i'm dead no jump in jump in jump in jump oh my goodness just you and me it has come down to you and me brollo how do you want to settle this if you've seen my channel before anytime there's a 1v1 situation we will always do a wild west 1v1 you

HkbbBcm_xBo,Can 100 Players Defeat the BEST Clan in Rust? *FINALE*,2205357,44954,1384,0 days 00:13:50,this is the best clan in rust ot i wanted to see if they truly are the best so i gathered 100 of my viewers to see if we can successfully raid them ot built a massive base on my server and brought 18 of their members each having an average of 7 000 hours in this game we'll be launching strategic attacks to see if ot can defeat every obstacle in their way in the first battle they won the second time we won but today is the final battle gentlemen this is it boys our final battle now look side to side these are your brothers we fight together until the end today but we need to start this attack right that's why we're launching a naval attack now go get in your boats three go two one hit the gates now at first ot thought our two scrap helis were bait they didn't see all the boats render in at first so they were very suspicious of another attack oh they're coming right they're coming from that side southeast southeast there's two scrapers coming in that's like 30 people it's distraction it's this direction 100 this is the last time we were attacking ot guys as soon as we hit those beaches it's gonna be d-day all over again as soon as we hit those beaches i want us to push up to that base it's not bad i repeat it's not bad it's all of them uh no there's a lot there's a lot no it's not just 30. they're flanking you guys on the sides be careful watch the sides watch the sides they're not kids our push was strong but eventually ot wiped out every single person ot just wiped out everyone not a single person from that push survived but the 100 players had four spawn points and admins at the server were transporting players back to the battle while they're shooting that scrappy oh they're focusing fire on that scrappy they get emergency land emergency lands and it's me you got the soldiers on the battlefield safely booming you're getting a medal of honor after this

launchers the pvp stage is over now the rating begins better see some rockets going i want to see rockets hit that base because we're hitting at all sides of the base it's impossible to cover this whole thing this is a massive base but when they hear that rocket you best know they're going to come for you so get ready now we had to call a vip content creator who's making an appearance later in this event the woman are you here yes i'm going to need you to take over the battlefield i am ready so i left gloomin in charge of the 100 players but he had a different strategy in mind okay boys you ready we're gonna charge him with these horses go go go go go horus is coming a lot of horses yeah they're searching on board go go go go go ot laughed as they murdered our horses ot continued to seal the base and the 100 players were struggling to get through so we need to do something big it's time to gather up the 100 players and launch a massive convoy attack filled with armored vehicles tanks and attack helicopters we need this organized push to work or else i'll need to call in the vip content creator for a backup plan oh down both hillary's down we need those tanks where are the tanks

server filled with natural disasters like tornadoes tsunamis meteor strikes and tons of other crazy disasters this is an experience you won't find on any other server so join our discord to stay updated it's also where we're hosting a frostbite skin giveaway now throughout this event there is an ot member who refused to pick up any guns instead he decided to use a bow the entire time and he played on the outside camouflaged in bushes like a stealthy ninja the rating continued but we still couldn't get past that second wall our normal rockets aren't doing enough damage we need like a new raiding technology something new we can raid with well boys that's why i reached out to a good friend of mine earlier this week rust academy are you hello here hello man have i got something for you academy what do you have for me man all right so we have been able to combine three rocket launchers into one so instead of shooting one rocket at a time you'll get three you can almost take out a stone wall just on the first shot this thing's an absolute weapon of mass destruction three rockets at once bro i call it the try launcher academy i appreciate your service the 100 players will appreciate this as well but it to good use yeah i'll see you on the battlefield soldier thank you very much the 100 players now have tri launchers instead of shooting one rocket at a time now everyone can shoot three wait that guy has a triple launcher i gotta get a quad launcher what the here's that one minion launcher what the is this yeah i know look at them oh my god we're shredding through sheet metal dude oh one of the towers is going down focus fire in the east tower wait the north one's almost done too this is the end of ot boys the tri-launchers were putting in heavy work and slowly ot's base was falling apart their towers were being destroyed and ot could feel the pressure as they slowly washed their base collapse they realized this might not be so winnable anymore and their frustrations started to show what classifies as a win okay but we're surviving we have been surviving for a while kind of one-sided right now they're shooting five rockets at a time they have l nines uh there's a hundred of them don't worry we just digging deep when we need to they're we got plenty of time digging deep plenty of time left that's that's absolutely the opposite of what i want to hear you gotta say like we have ten minutes left you know i'm not that's any time it's four rockets at a time man this is just insanity don't worry we just digging deep when we need to there we we got plenty of time the person you just heard was ot's manager called me down the team because he had a backup plan that is about to go into full effect a plan that him the clan leader tanza prepared before this battle yeah we gotta get out here wait why do we have trousers everybody t3 on the map right now go go go look to the skies fellas with good cue the avengers music i didn't give you guys points that's not us wait a second yo admits what's going on why why are there planes hello that's not us fancy that's other things holy ot's friends editors and more clan members arrived on the battle and now ot has 27 members defending this base but more importantly the morale of the team has skyrocketed as more of their brothers have joined this fight now we could raid this base all day and eventually we would win so to make it fair i'm enabling one life only everyone on the server will have one life and if they die they get kicked from the server no one can join back for both sides and whoever's team is the last standing will win this series wait no way this is a 1v1 oh my god it's a 1v1 no kitty the battle came down to a 1v1 and everyone else on the server was an admin watching so i brought the players together in the same call and we agreed no cheap rocket launchers no l96 snipers instead we have a wild west 1v1 gentlemen take three steps forward rau is representing ot gustav is representing the 100 players the winner of this 1v1 will decide which team wins this series okay everyone hold hands and pray i'm ripping my shirt off too is fired if he even fixes something when i shoot my python in the air you will turn around and kill your opponent here we go ots one voice it's over the series has ended boys 100 players versus the best clan and russ series has come to an end today and ot has officially won they indeed are the best klan and russ and deserve the title name if you want to go support ot this is their channel and they'll be in the pinned comments absolutely go show them support as they helped create this monumental collab in rust and although this series is over it's not the last time you'll see ot because they still have to raid

jzfdGob6yUs,Rust Death Swap but with 20 CONTENT CREATORS,935115,17388,473,0 days 00:14:51,quick you only have one hour to build a trap base is what i told these 20 content creators it's a series i have called rust death swap here's how it goes all 20 craters will build a trap and in one hour everyone will swap places and be put into someone else's trap it's your goal to escape the trap base and survive so this means you're going to see 20 different creative and unique trap faces from other content creators and them trying to escape the trap this is rust death swap three two one making a trap but i have to figure out what i'm gonna do so here we go for my trap my victim will be placed in a one by one held up by twig and on this deadly ice lake will be hundreds of landmines created in a snake formation now before i swap i'm gonna shoot the first landmine which will cause them to blow up one by one eventually it'll reach the twig where the entire one by one will collapse and shotgun traps will be below to escape this all you have to do is solve four simple math problems which will give you the code to the door but the landmines will psychologically mess with the victim knowing their death is getting closer and closer there's also going to be tons of voice recorders of me saying random numbers to throw them off even more so it looks like 30 landmines equals like five seconds of like thinking so i'm gonna need a lot of landmines for this oh and one more thing there's a punishment if you die in a trap today if you die in someone's trap the creator of that trap gets to make one tweet of their choice on your twitter so you're about to see tons of different weird tweets from someone if they die in today's video all right here we go the swap is starting swap is starting here we go oh wait it's dying oh fancy don't put this in your video but i have an abnormally small penis 10 seconds we got this oh here we go let's go oh god oh god it's tiny it's small there we go it's starting oh my god oh my god i can hear my landmines in the distance oh my god i wonder if they're gonna defeat it but first let's see who got my trap oh god it's so loud oh i left you a little present so you can finish digging your way out okay i got a knife um maybe something's behind this rug oh there's twig okay what's this oh a key oh all right well i'm just gonna jump over these that was so close okay uh nothing in this box i have a key though oh there's an auto turret there i'm just gonna run past this oh oh it's got a nail gun in it each cell had a number but some are green and some are red i realize the green numbers were the code to the next door okay two seven four two seven four five okay let's try that okay all right sweet there we go don't press this button i really want to press i have to i have to press it oh my god okay okay okay okay okay all right uh yeah maybe i should have done that um all right no no all right well that's ripped oh okay yeah i'm just gonna cut to the chase so you have five minutes to find a way to escape this room by finding the codes to the door if you don't make it within the five minutes wow yeah okay that that that will i'm going but it's gonna get much worse don't worry uh it's a button i'm not pressing that okay we got cameras what we got good what i need numbers i need a code come on here we go only start with this okay i mean i put my weapons away fair enough all right we have a key and we have two meds okay key unlocks this we have a note five five okay we got our first numbers okay come on baby okay i'm pressing the button wait that opened the door oh i bet that's gonna co wait four five five five four five oh my god i'm doing it okay let's go oh come on what is this in this next room you have 60 seconds to find the correct arcade machine that will set you free good luck okay go find the right arcade machine what how do you get out of it okay space ah i died am i dead oh my god i'm not dead i'm being honest i have no idea how you even survived that was not expecting you to make it this far for the worst so in this next one it takes exactly eight seconds to get to the end of the hallway where the exit is and if you're still sitting around by the entrance that means you only have 8.5 seconds left wait what i bet you're still wearing that heavy armor too aren't you you better run you got four seconds oh two one no oh my god yep i'm copping the l on that um okay this is flax trap he chose the coldest area on the map and submerged his victim with water and sprinkler so he dies quickly to the cold max has to quickly escape before it's too late to win like the firework on the beach oh dude this is easy bruh really is that there oh here's uh wait i'm gonna die if i fall down there it doesn't say i can't spawn in a bit of food wait can i land hey cheated max mears you weren't supposed to spawn in anything you have cheated max i hope karma gets you good that's rough okay that was oh i should have seen that coming man oh my god wait what the is this this is mimio's trap and he literally created minesweeper in russ it's simple some of these boxes have traps underneath when you put a hat in the box it gives you a number zero means there are no traps next to that box but if it's a one two or three that's how many bombs are next to that trap and bombs in this case are shotgun traps underneath the twig and if you put a hat in the box that has a bomb underneath it a door will open with shotgun traps bro you think i know how to play i'm a zoomer i don't know how to play minesweeper okay okay okay let's try to figure this out okay so let's go down the center let's hope he hasn't completely us okay okay oh wait there's zero next to it that means all of these are safe right hopefully please zero next to it okay oh okay there's one okay okay one one is close to me please oh no no i don't know how minesweeper works welcome to the house of pain okay what is this confusion needs to drive a helicopter to the top of a very narrow space one wrong move and he could easily crash and die oh my gosh what is going on oh please oh my god come on oh my god i see the end here we go we're out we live okay outside of this door is a series of riddles solve them to find your freedom i'm on one hour of sleep are you kidding me blaze needs to solve sarah winter's riddles in order to escape this trap well that's what he was supposed to do there was a locked box that was a part of the riddle but blaze had something else in mind he had a bunch of meds in that case i could make a hatchet i think it said that i could spawn in like a reasonable thing or something i think a hatchet is somewhat reasonable i fancy fancy hold up hold up hold up blaze has a hatchet in my base bro you skipped the whole first level with a hatchet wait did he spawn it yeah that was so good winter didn't understand the rules man even though you repeated him 10 times fancy okay i have a note can't touch this tc hammer oh tc hammer okay all right wait i see but there's more ames hammer jack camera oh oh i see okay it's telling me to pick all right well let's get picking i wonder jokes oh my god dude oh it says no jack come here ah dude i'm an idiot hey go god man what is this can't i throw something at the landmine oh what a what if i do this guys i don't think it worked uh what the hell is this i actually hate this already i'm sorry for exposing you soils but it literally took him 10 minutes to climb up a couple ladders to get to the main part of this trap built by iok oh dude what the dude an insane parkour trap in fact swales wasn't the only one struggling with parkour let's go check on a few other creators death parker oh god oh no i'm so bad at parkour you know i am really bad at parkour bro what is this man how am i wait there's like lasers no parkour's garbage man and all you give me is fish to get out oh yeah at least dirt rider was given meds to complete his parkour but he was given minnows no what is this can you only regain one health when you eat them who does this this is wrong i'm sweating you've got to be kidding me man oh gg man come on come on come on come on no no no i'm dead but not all craters were victims to the parkour but i did it i didn't i made it i did it yeah take that for whoever strap base that was okay that is obviously bait that front door you want to go to the front door because i'm probably going to get shot black needs to find which door doesn't have shotgun traps behind them once he does that's his escape okay okay there we go there is definitely ammo in that one bleeding bleeding bleeding that was on the brink of death come on son of a mother oh okay oh trivia okay i'm gonna go in november no i played legacy too goddamn okay choose a door 50 50. probably get behind this i can hear a scientist oh my god oh my god sh sh shut up oh wait what no way ah yeah yeah yeah i see i see i see oh okay if i just sprint that way oh no ah now shotgun traps throughout the escape of this trap built by confusion so he asked him if they were empty to trick his victim and indeed they were oh gosh a db and some meds oh brit got mine are you kidding me now break up max's trap it is a maze full of either traps or trolls and it's truly entertaining to watch their complete opposite reactions to the escape that one oh my god that's a turret wait the tarot assistant oh my god okay oh nice son of a wait i've got oh wait i've got medkit i'll stand up oh this isn't even funnier what is that um oh it's a tesla coil was that huh he saw the trout but it was too late that would have killed him ah just a little ejaculation of fire what the google translate i did use google google translate okay three five six two two there we go but unfortunately this wasn't the way out of the trap what the how okay there's gonna be like some oh 100 some like hidden don't forget the code don't forget wait to have the code with me yeah okay down here yeah okay what the you changed three five six two that's great bro i don't know what it can be don't forget the code now iok didn't forget the code it was actually the creator of this trap syncs now i don't know how he forgot the code to his own trap so he had to come and remove the door so i okay could finish it relax i'm not that mean or am i like it's responsible am i sending it it but i died i'm dead i'm the water maze that's fun though holy hello this is just jam strap he has a famous tik-tok series of these scary npcs and they're surrounded in this base with deadly traps blaze the way needs to find the escape before he dies oh oh ah that has ammo ah um um oh i'm out found the route congrats let's go oh of all the places that i could have just put that just gonna i'm dead no we were out three oh my god confusions,2022-05-30T16:15:48Z

pass up on this opportunity they have jet packs what the i'm getting distracted by the jet packs yo yo how do i fly this thing oh my god i'm going to the moon and because they got distracted it actually helped us get a little bit more control on the battlefield i killed myself a jet pack i'm coming down like superman the battle continued after the jet pack phase if he gained control of the trenches the weed help on east they slide inside they're hiding in the trenches man oh look there's like 20 in one of those little pods holy we got a lot of people like perked up on the the ridge of dome just shooting down just like giving sniper fire earlier you saw someone activating traps through a camera preventing us from getting to the base this is ot liam they call him the professor i sent the scout to locate his bunker and he's tucked away in a hidden force away from the battlefield he has access to every single angle on the battlefield and can activate turret traps from his control room now this is giving ot a major advantage that we cannot have anymore gloomin are you here gooman i am here yes uh so i need you to take over the battle okay do you think you can do that i will do that don't the squad come in i've gathered you all today because you are my best men on the battlefield there's one ot member located in this secret bunker activating traps and i need you guys to wipe him out only one guy this will be a piece of cake not exactly do not underestimate him you're dealing with one of the smartest electricians in rust let me show you this is his bunker it's pretty chunky so i'm giving you c4 for this mission he placed land mines all throughout this forest so you will need to watch your step he also has sensors surrounding this base so as soon as you get close to it he'll know you're outside lastly watch for his tesla coils once those are activated it'll shock everyone outside of the base confusion here will be leading you guys on this mission he is now in command all right boys this is going to be quick and easy everybody has a sleeping bag stay close together at all times we don't want to spread out let's go i witnessed my own friend get killed by

soldiers ot no longer has traps on the battlefield and now we can push up closer to the base all soldiers now have rockets so the rating period has commenced they're rocketing now they got rockets are they playing they're gonna start to get a little bit more pressure when they hear those rockets no one ever wants to hear a rocket hit their base now that we're raiding on all sides of the base it forces ot to split up and the pressure kicks in for them i'm going on the battle real quick what's going on boys we need to push boys are you guys ready to push i guess ready to push ready three two one let's go let's go let's go push push push push push let's go let's go let's go but regardless of our effort they still managed to defend and seal up the base i can't help but i have to seal i have to steal i'm sealing it i sealed one part sealed another part they also have turrets inside the compound that were slowing us down so we needed to do something big our next move is to group up the 100 players and lead a massive charge into the battle for this attack i'm gonna lead a tank into the battlefield and distract the ot members and every single player will have a riot shield riot shields don't exist in rust but we made it happen this needs to be the turning point of this battle all of us will charge across the main bridge your riot shields will protect you from any of their bullets i want to see every single person with their shields up and we attack together there's a tank there's a tank coming there's a tank coming i'm holding the bridge i'm holding the bridge i'm now we had

zRMNNjqG8lc,Rust Death Swap 8 ft. Memeio,435278,10199,1009,0 days 00:12:02,in this video me and my friends switch places every 30 minutes in rust and our goal is to kill the other player without attacking them this means we have to create some sort of trap that will kill the other player while they try to escape it it involves trap bases trickery mind games whatever you can do to get the other player to die this is rust death swap all right boys are you guys ready yeah all right all right three two one excuse me fellas i think you're forgetting the king of trap bases oh and today's special guest is mimeo every death swap

king of trap bases mimi you've done all sorts of i've seen you do a cactus trap base i've seen you do a dome trap base horse trap is like what do you have for pretty much any animal or object in the game i've somehow made a trend mimio i do have an important question for you i think you might know what's coming so every content creator i bring in my videos i give them something called the mama test you know what that is i've never heard of it what's the mama test pretty much you're gonna give us your best and we're gonna score it one out of ten are you up for the challenge it's your best moment i'm not prepared or anything you didn't study for the test i'm ready i'm ready all right we're ready all right so you're lying you definitely did study i'm trying to get a 10 point dude i have to give you a 10 out of 10. you know i'll give you a 9.5 oh no and i ruined it for my first strap my victim must defeat the bradley tank around this arena are points of cover like furnaces and repair benches and inside those are rockets my victim must use to destroy the bradley i call this trap hide and seek but before we swap you probably notice some of these furnaces don't have skins well you soon could have all of these furnace skins bandit.camp is a site where you can win tons of different skins for rust they have game modes such as the wheel from bandit camp coin flip bean can blast case openings in a new game mode called crate battles where you go against other players in a case opening battle you can also claim 3 cents every 15 minutes so you never stop playing and you can use my code fancy which will give you free scrap which is their currency for the site now let's start the first swap i see someone on the map that i don't like it's always forging by his porsche excavator pin oh oh okay one oh no oh what is this elevator there's an auto turret right there i think there's something on this box because i've done this in a previous death swap in the past death swap i use the same strategy where you hide a chest in a door frame so you can place a transmitter on the chest confusion died to it in episode 5 because anytime you try to loot it with a transmitter on it it can open doors and in this case the elevator will be turned on if i loop from the box wait for some note you'll need this oh no i guess there's only one thing to do and that's to go up oh no oh no oh oh my god oh oh my god wait where'd that sign say oh my god oh my god okay what do i hear is that bradley oh my god code is five five five five okay whose trap is this you have to fight a bradley tank

to death bring it oh code five uh four this is definitely past 60 seconds hold on a minute it has been over 60 seconds mimi let's save my first stop i don't like my nipples to be toasty i accept my death and the death oh you can't get me with this one man come on i made a video on this like at the beginning oh i did not know that i instantly killed you i'm not gonna lie well boys uh it seems

enjoy this snow scene so these are gonna be landmines right i've seen his videos in one of mimi's videos he did a trap base with a snow machine because you can use it to cover up land mines with the snow but porgy caught on to this and has a feeling mimio did it here again it's gotta move i want hp you you one hp baby i'll everyone oh yes yes that random food crate just saved porgy's life he was on one hp and was about to die to the cold but the food inside the crate just saved his life look at me oh it's underwater oh for porgy's trap he was trying to freeze his victim to death but since confusion had a hazmat suit on he was protected from the cold i i have a hazmat i can't dye the cold but i have satchels we are good to go wait so we all live we did we all survived hey so we all survived yo this is a competitive one dude since everyone has one point the next trap decides the winner and if everyone ties again after that i have a special way to declare the winner of this

maze the green targets are civilians and if you kill one of them the tesla coils shock you and the red targets are the enemies but if you don't kill them within two seconds you also get shocked this

this i'll be admitted abusing the entire server i can do things like call in drone strikes make it so lava rises and tons of crazy ways to kill these players when someone dies they get kicked from the server so there's no respawning and everyone only has one life you can hide and try to wait out the time or you can team up and fight against me but i'll have 10 000 hp because i'm admin abusing everyone that survives after the time runs out will get a ruskin so let's see how many people we can kill the event starts now you have 30 minutes to go prepare and hide everyone go go go go go go go go i gave the players 30 minutes to prepare so they could farm up and gather weapons before the hunting starts gloomin come over to me i need a mini copter right now i need an escort we're going to go find some people i'm here hello gloomin spot on minnie i need you to drive because i do not know how to drive now gloomin will be helping me today but he's not allowed to kill anyone but he did set up

how does this guy have a car too where are you guys getting these cars i i did not spawn cars around this map i don't know where you guys are getting these well that's because brawler was going around

hit so many times you jump into the ship you finish it now while i was brutally murdering people around the map brawler was formulating a plan to gather up survivors and create a sanctuary in the corner of the map okay listen listen don't tell anybody you can't tell anybody this is a secret man i'm gonna be making a sanctuary in k2 you got to keep it secret but you could tell tell people in voice chat make sure they don't tell it in the game chat fancy can't now k2 iceland i'm making a sanctuary come there in two minutes i'm gonna be making a sanctuary all the way in uh hey two okay keep it secret don't tell anybody there's a big base down here uh let me go ahead and get me high i got something for these guys back up back up back up back up oh my god oh my god holy oh he just died i saw the player counter go from 94 tonight that was the first drone strike of today ladies and gentlemen and that man did not survive uh yeah that's him unfortunately darkness now at this point there were still 89 players alive so i decided to use the helicopter again to hunt down the players where are you guys hello come out come out wherever you are i know you're hiding i destroyed every building in sight some had players hiding in it and some had nothing but then i realized most people were hiding in camouflage areas since the server had different kits made for different environments oh wait a second got some people uh building some tree houses okay i am struggling to find people now glenn was that you that just took a picture of me no someone's here someone is here what the are they using my 8x scope to look in these trees aha i'll just take them jesus christ how many pictures did you take of me you know what everyone i think it's time to raise some lava now lots of people were hiding underwater or out in the sea for example this group of submariners but as soon as lava raises it'll instantly kill out anyone in the sea i think it's time to raise some lava lava oh my god he's doing father you all have 10 seconds before lava starts rising we'll get them we'll get them as you can see from the counter the lava wiped out a good chunk of people lava is now rising so now you guys will have to start moving towards other places to hide now while the killing continued the sanctuary was starting to really form brawla was able to spread word of mouth that a safety sanctuary was formed in k2 and players all over the map gathered to help build it i still had no idea this was happening but eventually i'll realize that players are hiding somewhere is he on top of the thing and up there oh he's what the oh what do we have here jump jump jump jump go go go jump jump jump jump jump jump goodbye my friends oh some of the bases are being covered by lava this is good i like this it's giving people fewer places to hide there's a mini flying away taba okay chase after their mini probably them yeah what is oh this had a monkey noise i did too all right well we're coming in oh there's a lot of them in there dude there's a lot of them honestly if they stayed quiet they probably would have been able to live oh yep that is them what's up too fancy hey i appreciate the sign though there were 36 people left on the server and it was time to clear the last island snow island we haven't really checked so land me over here by this ice lake reason why i haven't checked this island is because i didn't think people would be here too cold there's not many places to hide and there's polar bears i don't see any bases i don't see people i don't see any sign of life what the so this is where you've all been hiding now who could have possibly organized this i did fancy brawler i couldn't stand watching you kill your viewers i witnessed it all fancy i was there on the front lines when you rocketed d2 i'm right here behind you what could i do what can i do to help you you guys think you're controlling is this controlling i saw you murder countless people before i took it into my own hands wait what the oh how do you think they got cars fancy how do you think they got the mini copters the ammunition the meds the m249s and the auto turrets it was all me i gathered everyone here to build a resistance i'm sorry fancy but i could not be on your side for this one rollo i i feel betrayed if i'm gonna be honest but i hope you know what i have to do

txu3CG7ojI4,Can 100 Players Defeat the BEST Clan in Rust?,1767733,33014,1082,0 days 00:14:01,this is the best clan in rust ot today i gather 20 of their members and together they have a total of 178 270 hours just between the 20 of them these guys do not mess around every single one of them are insane at pvp but today we're gonna put them to the test to see if they could defeat 100 players the ot builders created a massive compound with unbelievable peaks and we're about to see if 100 players can successfully raid them gentlemen today you don't call me fancy orb my name is general fancy and today i will lead you all into battle the battle has now started and the ot members were not letting anyone close to the base oh and quickly this is what the ot players are wearing and this is what the 100 players are wearing oh my god oh the ot guys are already beaming oh no oh my gosh holy they're already beaming obviously more people are connecting so we're gonna get more people on the front line this is just the beginning wave oh my god there's hordes of them coming from that way there's stars back there too we had spawn points surrounding their massive base so we could attack at different angles but some of the ot members pushed outside the compound to ensure no one could get near it and start raiding some of the ot members are pushing up guys they're pushing up pushing to add extra cover that's that's gonna be your best way to get up and push up to the base you guys need to work together push up together wall together do everything together we're gonna beat these guys we need to work together oh i hear c4 we've got c4 going oh we're getting ready oh yeah they're blowing their compounds off stone compound he's dead he said he said do that if you can if someone could push out ah it's east side east i kept going got me coming coming i got it sealed it took it we have to figure out this who this man is g50 you're a brave man for getting in there come on boys provide cover for each other place down those balls let's go let's go go around come on come on come on boys come on sports push here oh my god oh my god you need to go around we need to go round we're hearing c4 all right we got to breach we got another breach guys we're attacking from the north side i don't care how many c4s you use if we can break down every high external wall it's going to leave a huge breach just get some damage down our main goal is to destroy this building we were getting damage in on the north side of the base now with a ton of explosives happening in one area it brings all of ot's attention to that one area which allows more people to push up on other sides of the base soldiers on the side with the water were able to push up and so were the soldiers on the dome side now we were starting to put a little bit more pressure on ot guys we're losing control they're rocking it now they're blowing every single one every single wall northwest northwest oh bagel no oh dude they're covering every angle guys you got to be careful a lot of the ot players are up on the buildings a lot of them are on the ground they're everywhere guys and it seems like they're ceiling no guys they're already sealing up the base how so close still close on our breach northwest they're pushing you jewel they're pushing you they're pushing a jewel no holy where are they hitting you guys from but every time we were making progress somehow ot shut down the raid they continued to seal the base and nothing was working so now it's time to lead in operation i'm gathering up the 100 players and together all of us will charge and attack at the same time everyone will have rockets so this could be the biggest moment so far in the event there's so many go go this is good boys let's go let's go let's go we're getting progress we are getting progress we need to kill them we need to kill them i can't tell if i killed him what is happening because of all 100 people rocketing and shooting in one area it crashed the server but we rebooted the server and continued the battle oh my god one guy's in an insane spot up here holy stupid leaves on my face the battle continued outside of their base so now it's time to release another tactic that would send ot back to their base and allow us to push up you know boys it's time to release a military tactic boys i am now controlling a heli i'm gonna give you guys support from the air okay i literally have control the heli do not shoot me i'm gonna shoot those guys from the ground oh hell you're coming in hell hello i got one i got one they killed me what that insta died it let this insta kill you dude the hell he shoot the hell dude they're focused on me boys this is going to give you opportunity to push up wait what the hell is going on we got it we got it we got it called in a kill streak bro no they destroyed it what oh my god that's uh that's awkward that's awkward oh and if you want to join future 100 player videos join my discord these are open events anyone in my discord can join these recordings oh wait we got people attacking from the north side we're making progress over here oh my god these two guys are just holding everything down from northwest yeah they're somewhere it's like full corner they're pushing up to you guys they have a car they have a car yeah 120. oh no oh rad you're done dude you're about to die here oh my god they're running people over now this is this is not good oh my gosh it's a scrap hilly someone got a scrap kelly oh it's the ot's where does he take me up brings me take me up go go go go take off go go go go go how much health 20. oh you're dead you're gonna die focus fire on that scrappy if you shoot it enough times it should destroy focus fire on that scrappy now we're giving the 100 players access to better gear and guns to put up a better fight on the battlefield you guys will have snipers now you guys will have aks i believe you guys will have better guns with this kit there we go now there's a lot more shooting we also upgraded our air support and gave the soldiers scrap helicopters to see if we could get on top of their base i wish might be i'm not professional crafty coming in dude oh my god we got a scrappy of our team go go go oh go boys go go go go oh my god there's so many out of that huh we got a squad of people posted up oh they're c4 you know too well the the squad just got wiped out completely dude what the he's naked driving bro is that he's dead he says we killed him they all survived that was a perfect rocket we got scrappy incoming he's gonna crash it he's gonna crash oh my god he's suicided hey we will remember you soldier thank you for your service another scrappy oh my god oh my god now while this whole event was happening there's someone on ot who for some reason is insane with the compound though he refused to pick up any aks or m2s he literally only used the compound now it's time to cause some serious damage i'm going to fly another helicopter and create a huge bridge for the players to get in the core of the base here we go i'm shooting the breach in the north side the north side has a huge breach boys there's a huge breach on the north side you guys can get through there's a direct access to their base we're getting progress on the north side confusion confusion get him confusion no a lot of people are making their way through the base they're starting to get sidetracked here you guys can start pushing up a lot more easier oh my god oh we're starting to get through the garage doors soon we had access to their first floor and the outside of the entire base ot now relied on their upper floors to defend their base the soldiers see forward every single door in sight and slowly made their way to the top oh my god we're actually in the base oh my god they're destroying all the beds now holy although we were quickly taking over their base this is not how we wanted it to end so i called a tactical retreat to dome uh everyone come to dome everyone come to dome let everyone back up let's come to dome all right everyone pull out of the base pull out of the base listen to general fancy that is an order pull out of the base now now why would i do this when we were so close to taking over the base well ladies and gentlemen get ready for a major plot twist you may have noticed dome was in the background of this entire video and it was there for a reason soon this entire map is going to flood with water and water will rise until this map is completely covered dome is the only safe place since it's the highest point of elevation and all the soldiers will get to see ot's base flooded with water now the roles have been reversed in order for ot to survive this they now have to push us and we are the defenders protecting dome ot has no idea this is about to happen so let's see if they are truly the best clan in rust wait so are we supposed to push them i think we have to push them now dude let's push right now yeah oh so many took complete control over dome but there were still a ton of soldiers making a final stand at their base oh i just killed one shooting me i'm currently seeing the combat voice i'm trying to fight my god oh my god i'm stealing a lot boys i'm stealing me and chief have done every 100 player video i do i declare a winner at the end and today i declare ot the winners of the battle although their base was flooded they still managed to take dome from us and fought it out like brothers until the very end however as for now their base remains at the deep bottom of my server's ocean unless we do a rematch big shout out to ot and all of their members their youtube is linked down below if you want to see them more in action they also dropped a massive banger on their channel so i highly recommend checking that out too and if you guys do want to see a rematch against ot make sure to drop a like and if you want to see if 100 players can

brain schemes planned so oh okay okay my traps are horrible i know nothing of electricity i do have some basic knowledge soon i i have a question for you man wait on me fusion poor do you guys know what's coming a lot of people are looking forward to this i hope you know this all right every content creator i have in my videos i give them something called the mama test do you know what that is you gotta be kidding me i think i know what this is you're gonna give us your best remember and we're gonna rate it one out of ten all right are you up for the challenge all right oh all right oh okay when you're ready go ahead and give us your best mama all right wait a second that is one of the most underrated mammals we've ever had i'm going to give you an 8.5 out of 10. oh man it's pretty high it's an honor i'm going for the nine i would say 8.5 but that just came out of nowhere that was a pretty solid one i'll give you 8.2 i trained all night for that oh really you studied too man dude i studied for this we don't make the rules it's just maybe yeah for my first trap it's a big brain trick my victim is gonna be teleported in a long hallway of traps and a voice recorder that's gonna say hey you currently have 60 seconds to get to the other side or else that door behind you is going to open with a turret there will be a counter which would pressure the opponent to get to the other side now the hallway is very easy to beat and that's the trick at the end of the hallway is another recorder that will say the code is five five five five but i didn't say for which door and that's where the trick comes into play they'll think the code is for the door right in front of them and that has an auto turret behind it in fact the correct door is the one at the beginning which never opened it was hooked up to a fake timer that doesn't have a trap behind it and that is the escape to freedom i know we're uh portuguese trappists why are you at abandoned military base forging what are you doing there oh all right here we go guys wait what wait foreign oh wait no what is he doing oh no one of us is getting no more arrested what is this i have some parkour here is anything in this box oh whoever provided me with all these blueberries bless your soul okay oh oh i up i up guys i'm at the shotgun traps i fell on top of them i mean i think you could make it give us a bit hey i'll try it just for you here we go two one oh my gosh now porgy utilized the mlrs rockets and set up a decoy base for spoon kid and those rockets were coming right for him i have some parkour here is anything in this box oh oh my god i hear mlrs i hear envelopers what is happening it didn't work it didn't work like this it hit the other side of the base i guess i'm free oh hey you currently have 60 seconds to get to the other side you better hurry congratulations i knew you could do it you're so good at this the code is five five five five five hold on no that's a vape dude it's this one wait what hmm no i have the math one throw back to the last death swap video confusion made me solve math problems to figure out the door code and it looks like porgy also struggles with math orgy died confusion died fancy orb died but spoon can survive so congratulations spoon kid is winning how is he winning we were like professionals at this point what what is happening you know we need to step up our game spoonie at one point on the board and the rest of us have zero you're winning i'm on top of the world right now i've been training for months for this fancy your trap was so stupid i got outplayed there i'm not even gonna lie not my problem oh that trap was gay are you serious i used to be a big mobile mobile gamer but same do you pack joyride you play that oh yeah on my mom's phone dude please crash it clean let's go i still run it dude i'm not even gonna cap really doodle jump oh god yeah i actually installed that like last month on my phone there was a game where you like cut rope you're like oh oh yeah um what was it uh cut the rope cut the program yeah i know yeah i remember i'm convinced we had like the same like i touched same game like everything you names like i have probably dude my next trap is really interesting and you might actually learn something from it too in rust you can hide the tesla coils in the small pebbles on the beach and make them completely hidden i'm going to surround my victim with high stone walls and a chain-link fence that link fence right there is the key to this trap in this box are random items that they have to use to try to escape the trap it is 100 possible to escape but they'll only have 80 seconds to do it before every tesla coil and the rocks turn on after this swap i'll show you how to escape and it'll actually blow your mind dude why are you gonna make another information oh ignore the random farming we got that up here all right here we go i'm scared man oh no oh the code is all one digit my god this could be so annoying oh i got it is there gonna be something up there dude where are the chances these shotgun traps have no ammo confusion would you do that to me is this supposed to be a reverse psychology you want me to go up the doors what are the chances these are empty let's let's test it these actually might be empty let me do a quick drop down oh my god okay they're not empty i repeat they're not empty wait is this hello you're fine man dude this is really sesame here can i just walk off here oh wait and dude it was over i was trying to run what the no okay now spoonkit had his voice dlc settings off and when he tried to play my instructions this is all he heard but soon he slowly discovered what was going on oh okay do that ammo in confusion would you do that to me is this supposed to be uh i want to know what's up the store though stand up let me stand up i can crawl wait away second you're scared man god damn it poor jack got your trap dude that was a good trap oh what is this oh i'm losing fast health who did this code of course oh no it blocks back oh no it's the rug door gotta do it again do that no no luckily for porgy he didn't have to continue spoon kids trap girls he would have had to face a shark room that spoon had prepared for him oh my god i have sensor recordings on i didn't even realize oh there is a beach chair here place it like that sit in it and stand up oh that's cool all right so uh looks like we uh i think we all died right that means spoon kid is still in the lead that clutch auto turret where you die to when you're running away i did not expect that was not planned so i was supposed to live that wow you're supposed to live as i was leaving i was like dude this is so stupid elbows of confusion boom python shots i do have a very important question for you guys okay what do you think there is more of in this world doors or wheels wheels for sure 100 wheels are used guarantee there's more cars than houses okay but listen guess what all right there's a wheel yeah there's four wheels in every car but there's also four doors for every car so that cancels out it cancels out you're right exactly come on my side confused i i'm about a big brain everything no no no okay okay that that's great think about it you you're just thinking about cars you said wheels not cars i'll give that to you tons of corporate buildings okay think about all the buildings and like restaurants so many doors bathroom doors room doors doors to your closet every office pair has like five wheels on it and what about all those little wheels you know i'm looking at my chair and there is a one two three wheels for my next trap it's casino themed now in casinos it's all about getting lucky there are two doors in this trap which leads to two different obstacle courses there's a 50 chance of opening a door that gets to an easy obstacle course and a 50 chance of getting a hard one the victim can only open one door will they get lucky in the fancy's casino oh my god all right here we go boys the last spot make this one count oh run why do i need to run why do i hear chickens why is there so many chickens i'm scared to open this door man oh they're so cute

eliminated one if you step out of the circle two if you don't move your character for 30 seconds three every one hour will do an elimination challenge and if you fail you're eliminated nine contestants are in this circle but who will be the last one standing the last to leave the circle two has officially started good luck guys have fun before we start i'm allowing every player to select one item of their choosing to help them in this challenge harvest what would you like your item to be i would like a piano that sounds so fun let's do a satchel i'd like a c4 please i have a building plan the wooden gate thing can i get a watch tower take a wooden gate as well i want a crossbow all right send oh the return of sen now if you remember correctly sen was one of the contestants in the other last to leave the circle video and he absolutely dominated until he was eliminated by rng so i brought him back since he was a fan favorite i want to see phone then you have experience in the circle man i feel like you know what you're doing boys i i do have some bad news we just started this event but someone is about to be eliminated damn it dude choose one weapon from that box go go go go go go in this box are nine random weapons but they must choose carefully all of you guys chose your weapons i hope you chose very carefully because one of these weapons will eliminate you oh let's see what everyone doing so i hope it shows carefully so moon jumper got the ak the glorified ak but will it be glorified in this next challenge oh my god before we do this would anyone like to trade their weapon oh yeah yeah i know if anyone must have traded i'll let you guys straight i will let you guys if anyone wins i got the most generic weapon come on yourself everyone is keeping their weapon all right i'm gonna spawn a bradley tank and one at a time each contestant will shoot in but one of the weapons will instantly destroy the bradley tank and that means you're eliminated the question is who wants to go first i'll go first i'll go second second three in three two one you only lasted 10 minutes spend it but i'm sorry it's time for you to step out of the city and before bandit stepped out they planted seeds in his memory and memory of bandit out of everyone in that circle who do you think is going to win i got my money on moon jumper right now i think he's going to bring it all the way all right everybody that's the first person eliminated look at the virus in the background out there now the challenge has officially started and it's time to see how these players will compete in the circle you know what i'm going to go up in my tree house the last time someone plays a piano there's a satchel and two c4 in the circle so just be careful you could very well lose that treehouse oh man i wish i have a skin for his crossbow well nazmi if you could kill five npcs with the crossbow you're holding before i finish talking about the sponsor i'll give you a new crossbow skin today's video is sponsored by russ clash flash is a website where you can play different games and win rough skins they have tons of different cases you can open and win skins and even have case battles where you can go against other players not to mention they also have an upgrade or game mode the cool thing about clash is that they have a feature called rain where every 30 minutes they give away a ton of money to the people on the site now if you want to open free cases on this site go to free cases and type my code fancy you'll start off with three free cases but play responsibly let's go congratulations nazmi i'm sending you a skin right now good job everybody i mean i wish i could join them man you guys seem like you're having fun you'll regret that later and send was correct i do have many tricks up my sleeve and creative elimination challenges that will put these contestants through hell they have no idea what's coming later in this challenge at first the contestants were getting to know each other by introducing themselves and spence even read cat in the hat for everyone but soon we faced the first war crime in the circle i'm drinking people the moon you almost stepped up i know i saw that i was like oh i almost i almost stepped out i won't blow it up aj blow it up you can actually play oh man this is fantasy's fault put it down you get it you know considering that he did block me from entering my treehouse for a good minute all right guys it was me yeah come on i didn't like the piano the piano is looking at me funny okay don't be the next brock that's all i gotta say i won't be the next brock brock was a you just heard the contestants refer to brock in the first lash to leave video a contestant named brock betrayed the whole group and made the circle a living hell to be in sen had to deal with it all and now we're starting to see it happen again there's a moon jumper so today so it looks like they banished you from the tree house is that true i guess moonshipper who do you think has the best chance of winning this probably sin because of his hours hours don't mean anything we know son of an afk in those oh that place is stinky because of you yeah that's right chance yo guys that son you gotta keep them from the team around yes right now it seems like spency moon and nazmi aren't a little team together at the bottom while everyone else is at the tree house it seems like groups are starting to form just like the high school days man we get the cool kids at the top and like the social now as soon as they leave school what are they gonna do go party when we leave school we're gonna get a job and get money for our wife and kids the circle was split into two clear groups the good guys at the top of the tree house versus the villains at the bottom moon jumper already blew up a piano and spencer was trash talking sen for his hours powers don't mean anything we know son of an afk in those nazmi in the ninja suit is working with moon jumper as well to create a potato farm for the circle all right boys it's time to do our first elimination challenge so could everyone come down oh i already know what's happening it's time to do the first elimination challenge i'm standing outside the circle and each player will throw a long sword at me to be safe from elimination the sword has to make contact with my character whoever fails to do this will be eliminated wait a second did you see that said was trying to grab a sword but it looks like he stepped out of the circle so we had to replay the footage together to see if he was eliminated yeah you see the shadow oh no wait wait no no no no no replay there was a show oh there was a shadow i'm so close oh my goodness sen barely escaped illumination now back to the challenge okay spencer makes contacts sen makes contact he is safe he's gonna make it and he does all right now's me you can go when you're ready oh he lined up his crossbow using the crossbow and he gets it nozbe just used his crossbow to his advantage to hit the shot see that is how you use your items oh this is brother next contact please harvest it all right so moon you're on the chopping block it's now down to moon jumper if he misses this he is eliminated but if he hits the target he goes to overtime against harvest the person who owned the piano that moon jumper blew up earlier you don't deserve it everyone come down for the send-off let's let's have some responses dude but it's time for you to walk off goodbye i'll be loud i will remember they didn't miss you nazmi that's what you get moon it was a great guy that's what you get from growing up i have everyone in that circle who do you think will win this challenge nc boy you think spency boy yeah all right that is the second person eliminated we are going to do our items now because that was an elimination challenge after everyone you get an item so everyone make a line after every elimination the players can select a new item of their choosing but soon another player was about to commit a war crime you know i won the recycler i think i want a stone gate all right is it dear what would you like better go oh my wait a second anything just happened you say goodbye to your trees holy i'm i'm crying inside actually that was like my home you know this means war nazmi no this means war hey holy the circle has declared war and the two teams are now furious with each other because nazmi just lost moon jumper who was his closest ally he took his anger on the other group and he decided to see for the treehouse to get back at them all right let's continue items let's just continue items a refinery tier three workbench large high external wooden gate the same thing another wood gate there you go you guys have all of your items back to the challenge watch out that the recycler is very close to the edge you don't want to get pushed off because if someone pushes you off and you touch the outside you are eliminated after what nazmi just did there is now tension in the circle it's very quiet the vibe has changed after that first elimination he started the civil war oh oh on peter did you place the lock yeah i played a lot dude so now you guys have to be careful if you want to enter this recycler you have to step around hold up break it twice break it boys oh what is happening i have no idea what's happening it's very quiet it seems like people are playing again and bravo you guys want to explain like what's going on here a shame oh my god spency trapped two players in this wood base and peter put a lock on the gate secretly peter and spencer were working together and peter betrayed the good guys now the villains had two hostages from the other team there are two people trapped in here now you want to get cozy peter do you have access to this gate do so you're the only person able to let zadir and harvest out of this gate wow then negotiations started to form to let the trap players out what do you guys have i got 10 scrap 13 metal frogs you want that can i have your rock how do we know you keep your word the gate will open harvest come to the edge of the gate look up you guys want to drop in that that spike does do damage if you die to that you are eliminated this is the new treehouse i see yeah yeah treehouse you like it up here it looks cool it looks cool nice losers in here oh my god spence you're just clowning on them at this point stick with oh oh my goodness oh man the three kings stand in power oh my goodness indeed the three kings were powerful spency has taken full control of the circle by trapping players and outsmarting the other team peter and nazmi were by spency's side calling themselves the three kings but sen was not going to let that happen he has 7 000 hours and one of the smartest players i even know zudir secretly tossed the oil refinery he chose at the beginning of the round and sen was able to make machetes and toss them down to the trapped players just in case so now they're gonna be able to soft side out holy sen how did you get metal frags oh my god they're out pull please let's go oh oh someone is a little house they're there uh truth well um what the are we gonna do on a dare walk out someone's gonna say that who in this call is your favorite probably son oh really what a success kiss ass i spend so much time in your discord with yourself i think it's that time where we're going to get set up for the next elimination challenge are you guys ready it's going to be a spinning wheel oh no the next elimination challenge is musical chairs i'll be playing music and the players must go around the circle of chairs when the music stops you sit in a chair and the person who doesn't claim a chair is eliminated it was fun having you here nazmi has been eliminated out of everyone in that circle who do you think is going to win i think it's gonna be brollo he's he's very focused on winning i can see that congratulations you guys are the final six but it is time to do items our favorite time of the hour now i gave the players an option if they didn't want to select a new item they can choose to remove something from the circle does anyone want to remove i'd like to remove the the gate thank you harvest you have done a great service for me i want a tier three workbench let's do a wood gate a metal chest plate okay please i want a rocket launcher you want for that rock bro i have some cloth no don't yourself sand your piece of there was anger in the circle as the villains lost yet another player after an elimination challenge they also added doors and created a new building in the circle yeah i mean if you guys are bored you could jump next you got locked in spency wait he's light in right he's currently locked in it's all part of my plan man peter might be able to get him out actually oh my god i hate you guys you're stupid i have five thousand hours i know what you're doing buddy you're trying to repair the wall that i'm breaking hey i'm saying just so you know there's gonna be a little barricade blocking you from the building there you go peter's teaching send a lesson

really big brain to see it yeah really your ego is kind of showing right now bro yeah buddy how about we how about we all find a restaurant and then we all call it this is all called a green domino we should all say can i get a burrito with a side order of black the players wanted to do prank calls but we couldn't find anyone to pick up the phone mcdonald's ain't gonna answer what the hell it's mcdonald's after another 30 minutes of being in the circle it was time to do another elimination challenge i created a basketball hoop and rust well kinda each player has a different colored rock and

circle was calm but what was about to happen is going to make the circle put their differences aside and start working together the is that what the is happening samson um i don't want that sound that mlrs meteors will now be falling at random from the sky if any of the players get killed by it they are eliminated now these things are dangerous and the contestants are about to witness its true power this is something you guys are going to have to start watching out for now oh no oh my god does it destroy buildings fancy it can wait does it instant kill it does institute listen everybody we could prevent you know our extermination we can make a roof over the circle yeah let me show you guys an example of what this meteor will do oh my god okay all right there's no point okay no chance so how does everyone feel now that this is in scared i mean all you have to do is just get out of the way this is true when you hear that pack up your and run at least because we have a piano here in beautiful minecraft music and harvest is actually playing this from his own piano at home so this is not just some playback it's coming oh oh it sits okay nowhere in here yeah there's no way that one will go way out there some of these will miss so you'll have a break every once in a while theory i didn't know i could fall in love with a man so you guys were exchanging laughter things are looking hopeful back again in the circle just like they were in their first round peter i'd be very close if you oh oh peter you just destroyed a landmark yo yo yo pick up chippy oh my god it's coming right for us you guys might want to get ready we're good we're good we're good i can't that one was a little close oh my god no that one was a little too close for comfort that was so scary yeah i thought

with the others what the i don't know how he got here everyone was a little too happy in the circle and i wanted to cause some trouble we know what one meteor is capable of but let's see what happens with 20. that's trace that is three meteors hit will any of them hit uh all right oh oh oh oh bruh oh holy oh my god he landed on top of me did anyone died i honestly thought one of you just died with that being said it's time to do our next illumination challenge you guys are not gonna like this wheel now i do have some bad news uh two people are gonna be eliminated what oh man yeah so the wheel has five names on it and i'll be spinning it twice whoever it lands on will be eliminated i can't look at this is the first person eliminated oh my god that is harvest yep i can confirm that is harvest let's let's walk off together guys everyone over here you may step off when you're ready oh my god five hours later no everyone in that circle who do you think will win this challenge peter peters shouldn't win but it will be peter it's just that's just how it's going really we are now down to three people how are you guys feeling after that be honest my heart is a little empty right now fancy i just lost my last teammate uh peter you first lost who was a moon jumper and then you lost nazmi correct was that honestly nazmi could go himself i was with harvest sue dear and sen so both sides lost a teammate wow with that being said we can now choose items and since we lost two players from the circle i'm letting the contestants choose two new items large uh wood gate i guess a tier three workbench i would like an 8x and some rifle ammo a large wooden gate and a tier 3. boys oh that's coming straight oh that is coming straight i gotta get out of the way that is coming right to you guys i would get out of the way right now that is coming right to you guys oh my god it looks so much bigger in the sky well that is just a reminder that you guys have to be alert this challenge is not over yet that could have hit any of you well we're all here let me get a solid mama from the three of you brother let's hear your mama it's a little croaky so i'll give you eight out of ten so that's pretty good okay all right i'll give you a 7.5 out of 10. the zoo deer what are you forcing me to do i have to hold my vocal chords at a certain point all right let's do it you say that's like a three out of ten wait yeah that's how i would rate it are you ready to do our next elimination challenge you guys know my famous series called death swap yes so i have a series on my channel called death swap where me and my friends swap places and rust and we try to kill each other there are three people in this circle currently and i'm on the outside everyone will swap places including me so that means someone will be swapped outside of the circle where i'm standing and if they're outside of the circle that means they are eliminated no no we're doing rng then so this is another r what's interesting here is that peter and brallow have both been in death swap videos they were featured in the 20 man death swap video oh i jumped too soon oh oh let's go let's go oh my god they have the death swap blood in them but zudir does not oh boys good luck cross your fingers do whatever you believe good luck boys my god oh my god holy holy oh my god oh my god so dear uh go ahead and say goodbye to the group i will see you again all right so dude let's let's get your interview man uh the two in that circle right now who do you think is going to walk away with a win you know i think odds were stacked against peter this whole time and for him to live this long it's got to be peter the deer is gone and it is now down to the final two congratulations boys you guys have been through it all yeah the ups and downs you know do you guys have any final words with each other do you guys like each other do you guys hate each other after this i i wasn't too much of a fan of peter because you know i he didn't want to choose a side he wasn't refusing to join you know me and my team since then i think we've you know we've grown part of it i'm super happy to see that it's him kind of sad

on which painting is the best and my own viewers will declare who the winner is of this challenge both contestants won't be able to see the votes and it'll be revealed after five minutes of voting this might actually be kind of bad what's gonna happen is we're both gonna be in my main discord server oh my god and everyone will decide the fate of you guys they won't know who is who you guys won't be able to see the votes and after that i will reveal the winner it's finally time to finish this challenge and declare the winner of the circle i gathered over a hundred discord members and together they voted on which painting was the best this is peter's painting and this is bralo's painting two very different approaches but whose will be the best everyone it's time to vote gentlemen

here we go oh i got it no yeah that didn't go so well but after checking combat log i did 63 damage to that helicopter that means it is possible to destroy it with bows so today i called in backup to see if 100 players could destroy heli only using compound bows to warm up the 100 players for battle we're gonna see if they can take oil rig with just rocks then after we'll see if it's possible if 100 players can defeat the bradley tank with just rocks and our final mission will be taking down heli with compound bows first let's see if 100 players can successfully take oil rig with rocks only now i need one person who is very responsible to hold the red key card you sir what is your name my name is azer has a very important role carrying the red key card we need the card to activate the crate room to call on the heavy scientist so if azer loses this card everyone loses and so the 100 players swam to oil rig to take it over however we were having trouble getting people up the ladder one person even tried speed running to the top but he didn't make it so far and even locked himself into a room where he eventually died but slowly we were making progress on the first floor everyone was starting to work together and a strategy was formed but if you saw one person hitting a scientist two to four other people would join in since the scientists can only focus on one person though 100 players also realize they could farm the scientists bodies and crab bone knives which would make this takeover much easier get the bone cracks make bone knives oh everyone everyone's saying make bone knives this is good that's a smart idea and eventually the 100 players stormed their wage at the top of the oil rig on the final platform this is a complete war on top of the oil rig everyone is fighting together you all our brothers pick each other up and get back into battle wait a second where's azer we need him up here well azer was stuck at the bottom still because no one moved for him even though he had the most important role for this mission but eventually azer was escorted up to safety with the help of a few soldiers now it's time to open up the red key card room and call in the heavy scientists this is gonna be the most challenging part of the mission and a lot more people are about to die but then this happened again everyone was so focused on the loot inside they wouldn't even move for acer to swipe the card we were literally waiting five minutes for everyone to clear guys the heavy man is trying to get in so you guys you have to move guys so eventually i had to send some people flying in order for them to move i'm so sorry try to warn you dude all right who else wants to go flying then we got in and the heavy scientists were called all right boys the heavy scientists are on their way this is the final stage of oil rig oil rig turned into a massive war there were a lot more casualties but it made people work together even more some people found long swords to kill the scientists and some even found flamethrowers some people however decided to take no part in the fighting and watch their fellow brothers die instead but eventually the heavy scientists were on the run guys the heavysiders are running chase after them and once everyone cornered the final scientists it was over it is possible for 100 players with rocks to defeat oil rig now on to mission 2. let's see if 100 players can defeat the bradley tank with the just rocks now in normal rust you can only damage the bradley with explosive but i made it so it could be damaged by anything so in this case one rock hit equals 1 damage and the bradley tank has 1 000 health points now you guys are fighting bradley okay go go go find bradley and go kill it the first wave of people that charged into launch site were immediately destroyed by the powerful tank we were gonna need a lot more reinforcements to push up and take one for the team lots of people were dying but we were getting damage in oh the bradley's on fire now boys keep going keep going we had the bradley tanks surrounded but there were still tons of casualties a small farming team were hitting trees near launch site so they could craft spears to supply the army with better weapons now it's finally time to see if 100 players can defeat the heli using compound bows only and this time there are no respawns everyone only has one life and if you want to join future 100 player videos we record this all in my discord these are open recordings everyone can join these events alright everyone spawn in and go to t3 i have something prepared for everyone and t3 go to t3 go go this is fort fancy this will be the base we use to fight heli there are tons of buildings to provide cover and the 100 players will need to protect this village with their life i told everyone to meet in the church of fancy because i was about to tell them some bad news all right everyone listen up you all are now members of fort fancy and we must protect this place with our lives but i must inform you guys i do have some bad news this isn't a normal heli okay we actually have buffed up heli to make it more challenging for you guys i know i'm sorry the rate of fire is sped up the machine gun does more damage and the rocket radius is much larger so it shoots nukes instead of normal rockets you guys are strong though good luck and i believe all right everyone i have called in the heli get ready everyone launched their arrows at the same time once heli approached the fort fancy but then the heli made an insane rocket attack on the main building but all of a sudden heli caught on fire and to my surprise the heli started to go down everyone was cheerful and fort fancy was in celebration but i was not 100 players instantly took down heli in less than a minute using compound bows only i didn't even get to see the full potential of the destruction it can cause so this time we're bringing in three helis they quickly took down one but can they take down three all right boys i've called in three helis now and they're on the way i have a feeling this one won't be so easy tactical shopper incoming the first heli approached fort fancy and the 100 players were able to get some damage but then the second heli arrived and casualties were starting to form but the 100 players were able to take down one heli two more to go now while others fought for their lives some chose peace for the church the church must be peaceful boys we must we must abstain from violence cross your weapons but it didn't go so well after this happened the main building of fort fancy was melted by rockets and we lost about 20 soldiers but second heli went down and there was one more left there were only a handful of soldiers alive and we only had two more buildings remaining this was going to be a close battle but then we lost a ton of soldiers with one building left oh my goodness it's just these five people left in this one building rockets oh this might be the end oh oh you guys are done after this oh here comes the heli run this might be the final rocket run oh no here it comes oh oh my god all five people just got wiped out everyone wanted a rematch because they believed they could take down the helis this time they'll only have to defeat two helis but they get yokas with slug shots this time one guy left carly man you're the last man the 100 players were unsuccessful and didn't even get one heli but in the end the question has been answered and the 100 players can take heli using compound bows only and if you want to see if 100 players can defeat the best rust pvper click the video on your screen,2022-02-25T15:48:30Z
SlbAjCyHNao,Rust Death Swap BUT WITH 20 PLAYERS,546266,10711,298,0 days 00:16:45,this is rus death swap in one hour everyone will swap places and the goal is to kill each other without attacking the other person that means you have to set up a trap before you switch places it involves trap bases trickery mind games whatever you can do to get the other player to die usually i do this with three people but today we're doing it with 20. everyone has one hour to set up one trap and when it's time to swap you're going to see 20 different creative and unique traps from other content creators and fans of the series this is rust death swap three two one go go go go go go go go go go go go oh my god good luck boys twenty man death swap twenty minute test buff let's go everyone go to your pcs go to your vcs go go go today i have placed 20 players in here some content creators that you might recognize and some of my discord members and we're going to do a 20-man death swap now i have never done this before with this many people usually it's worth two to three but this is this one's gonna be crazy now there's only gonna be one swap but you're gonna see 20 different trap bases from different content creators or fans of the series so everyone's gonna be putting their creativity together for this one video not gonna lie i'm kind of nervous though because i have no idea what people are going to prepare for this man i bet you some people have been waiting to get their hands on a death swap video and they're finally going to release their massive creation there's a ton of different things you can do in rus and so i'm excited to see what these people have in mind for my trap there are three levels to escape to freedom the first level is a laser room where you have to avoid crossing the lasers or else it'll open up doors that have traps behind them once they go up the ladder hatch they're on the second level which is a bear trap maze after completing the second level they'll see the exit and think the trap is over but i'm hiding shotgun traps right at the end for a surprise attack here we go the swap is starting in 60 seconds 20 people are about to be teleported and we're gonna see a bunch of trap bases i am nervous for this my heart is beating oh here we go here we go boys oh 10 seconds i'm actually scared dude yo here we go here we go five seconds oh i'm scared oh here we go oh don't blow just have fun find your way out oh my god what the is this dude okay so i'm guessing the the empty turrets oh oh there's a flak trick on me okay there's a pressure pad under this carpet that turns on a tesla coil and i learned this trick from mr flack in my last video someone used the same trick in this trap base and later i discovered who made this trap and it was none other than mr flack himself i have to go this way go back it says go back but i wanna oh i made it okay this has gotta be it this is the entrance oh i'm gonna try to blow through that door oh wait there's codes three seven eight five oh i have four satchels i'm going through that door there's numbers on the wall here but i don't give a i'm just blowing through oh my god that almost killed me all right please tell me this is the way out it's foggy i don't know if i should go in there there's the exit is there a trap up there no shotgun traps if i press this

want to touch anything anything in these boxes oh has he that's better than what i got i don't want to touch that button i'm not even gonna lie i don't want to touch that button there's a note code dash dash nine find all parts of the code yo what in the jigsaw is this we got another note nine okay so it's something nine something nine oh we got another note something nine six nine it's gotta be six nine six nine right i mean i don't even know i don't mean i don't need the last code yep six nine six nine god damn it dude i'm not gonna press that button oh i'm yeah no i'm not pressing that no

this page okay easy enough easy enough which oh what the f oh okay now i see what you're doing here okay f in chat yes sir yes sir what the is this this here is sebi k's trap he calls himself the eco king so that's what he's making his victim do the trap player has to eco-raid out of this trappist but as you can see there are sprinklers in this trap which is meant to freeze you and slowly lower your health but luckily for spency he has a snow suit which is preventing him from freezing don't freeze a sword oh my god wait this is easy i got this i just have to start out the wall i think wait a second wait this could be a trap which way eco king don't freeze what if going out the wall is the wrong way i get them both low i wonder if i break the floor oh what if there's land mines there might be land mines under landfire behind this wall possibly land mines let's go what is this what is this it's just more hey well i should break this now oh there was land mines let's go baby let's go baby i was completely wrong but i still got out let's go baby two one oh oh parkour uh no ladders so it looks like i gotta do a bit of parkour guys i'm gonna try to concentrate i'm yeah i'm not gonna make this i am not gonna make this up here i could yeah okay okay i think i'm kind of lucky i got this i have i haven't got a time limit so oh okay that's good okay around this corner oh there's a shotgun trap right there i don't think i should be oh no oh okay they did ladder parkour i've really seen this in minecraft probably i don't actually know you could do yeah i'm fine i'm fine okay i'm alive there you go all right one more one more drop no no dude i thought i had it it was the last jump now this here is porgy's point of view but for some reason the trap he got had no escape he literally checked everything and there was no way out so what did porgy do yes great guys great trap make it so there's no way to escape except picking out we'll check back in on him later he's happening okay welcome to raptor's door maze amazing bad joke yeah it was this trap is simple find a way out good luck oh and there are turrets everywhere oh they're auto closing it's a maze what a face i think this calls for this outfit oh my god it didn't shoot why didn't this shoot yeah scarecrow i'll take that what is this maze where are we where are we what the find the key okay so i guess we have a escape room i don't want to open these doors these doors start sketching me out bro do it no no please i knew it one of these doors must have the key behind it traps behind them and that one okay oh we got the box prompt yeah let's go the key all right we're gonna go back down slowly oh a note find the code for the exit the code is found in this order we at least know there's a nine one but where does the key the code go all right let's check this one i don't see anything oh no no i don't want to paint the sign okay we thought we found it we found our exit we need it we have a nine and a one a two okay oh yeah see if we drop down there i knew it bro two one five nine oh we got the code okay we're good don't fall all right we gotta do this parkour but we good at parkour we good at parkour bro no no worries here no worries here oh there we go let's go oh oh make medkit jump off uh i'm guessing i just jump up here scattered around this base are a bunch of resources you need to make a medkit to survive this trap bloomin has to jump off a building with a med kit in his hot bar because any time you go down and rust and you have a med kit in your hotbar it'll pick you up 100 of the time but gloomin already has a med kit in his inventory uh oh i see okay well i don't need to make a medkit i don't think take some tips from this all right take some tips oh i don't know if there's a way out i see a way out no my time is over oh you have 100 seconds to complete the maze before the auto turret at the end of the turrets wicked oh okay let's do this in this trap garage doors are closing and opening automatically and suss needs to find his way out before the turret turns on at the end of the maze he's so creative but off what oh my god oh off how do i get out of this oh my god it's open oh let's go oh what is this shotgun traps everywhere can you provide the deadliest me than the rest facing the correct way what exactly is this supposed to be man it's obviously what doesn't even have

XESfJSkPsMs,Rust Death Swap 6 FINALE,388676,9714,699,0 days 00:20:13,this is russ but every 15 minutes me and my friends switch places our goal is to kill each other without attacking the other person how do we accomplish this traps before we swap places we set up a trap for the other player and if you escape the trap you earn a point it involves trap bases trickery mind games whatever you can do to get the other player to die this is russ death swap and there's a 16 chance you're subscribed so if you are right now you'll want to change that so you don't miss a future death swap video are you guys ready in three two one all right boys stop following me why are you following me look i got a cake he's got a birthday cake where'd you get that it's for you because you won the last well guess what i also have a cake look at my cake all right boys so this is death swab number two wow we are oh we are already on number six it feels like we just started the series yesterday confusion doesn't it sure does yeah our baby is growing and it's it's six years old now our baby is six years old now but you know guys i'm gonna i'm gonna break it to you guys this is the last death swap where it'll be three people in the next death swap it'll be a fourth person added it was fun well it's the three of us it's wonderful the fourth person could be but guys i'm sad this will be our last swap with the three of us man we've we've been through so much man so sad what have we been through we've been through casting couches plus we got plenty of those uh what else have we been hellies i remember the heli confusion can't forget about the the landmine maze porgy can't forget about the lead my maze that thing was terrifying enough talking all right we're not friends at the end of the day i'm here to win so i'm gonna kill all of you i'm just collecting nonsense in my inventory i gotta start focusing on what my first trap is gonna be oh you're gonna like mine for my first trap i have literally built an escape room only a big brain can solve this so let me show you how it works see that button right there that's how you start the trap once the timer hits 85 seconds you're out of time and two doors with auto tourists will open and kill the player the first hint is a key in this box with this key you can open up a key locked box up there in that box is a note that says 3617 and with that code you'll go to the computer station and enter it this will give you access to a camera that has another code on a sign that says 1981. using that code you can unlock that box up there which will give you a glue with that glue you can use it to buy another key at the vending machine that key will let you open the locker which has the final two digits you need to stop the timer once you stop the timer the door opens for your freedom yes i know it's a lot but like i said only a big brain can figure this one out everything is working the station is complete i just had the best idea rust youtuber boxing event oh let's go all right portrait who are you gonna call out are you gonna call out don't take on anyone save one youtuber right now russ youtuber who you're calling out right now say it i got it beat up well and it's only fair oh no hello decide if i actually want to call it someone to hate in the rush community or someone i just want to jokingly box you know what yeah i feel like me in syncs you know i feel like that'd be a good match maybe a little jordan ransom no he's gonna saturate you don't do that no you're right dude he's gonna give you the satchel oh no oh god dude here we go all right boys good luck uh mine's pretty fun uh just read the note read the box oh oh my god no way wait what what oh my god oh my god what the what was i supposed to do what was i supposed to do oh my god just read the notes oh oh my gosh how did that happen read the note read the box oh 85 seconds to escape the room by finding the right two numbers for the left and right buttons starting from right when you hit the middle button first clue is is the key good luck i don't like that oh this one seven three six one seven did it work this door three six one seven okay work either that what's can't get in there oh there's a box oh is this oh oh yeah i just don't know i keep parkour oh three six one seven oh oh the computer station oh dude i'm hiding behind the door three six one seven i added it i'm looking through the camera it says 1981 balls okay what was your trap confusion because what all right as soon as i teleported i heard you say got around you gotta run i'm like oh no i pressured you already so if i just stay there everything would have been fine it would have been fine well everybody we all lost because none of us survived so that means everyone has zero points still so anyone could still win this i'm upset that i feel for confusion's little trick i know what my trap's gonna be i need a lot of doors for this one for my next trap i'm placing my opponent in a room full of doors and on the wall will be a ton of buttons it'll definitely confuse my victim but every button they press it'll open a random door in the room all of these doors have traps behind them except for one which is the escape to freedom it's all about finding which button is the correct one oh here we go oh man all right good luck guys i hope you have fun with mine you're gonna think what the i'm gonna win oh what is this no not again oh oh my god oh are you gonna escape this one i got your trip into the center thing oh no i don't like your i gotta stop your recordings guy you're so i hate your recordings are you gonna escape ben uh i mean no lately i hear audio turrets i hear auto turrets where's it coming from all right i can i have five c4 that can blow out of two walls i see twig right there why do i see twig okay wait i think i think i might get this one okay i have a ladder no i'm down die i'm down but i could still get up you can see if someone's down let's go i'm gonna win oh what is this no not again this is a throwback to death swap episode one in episode one i swapped confusion right on the heavy scientists and oil rig and it was timed perfectly you just made me take oil rig this time confusion was able to avoid the heavy scientists and avoid death i'm going to win what in the name of why are there so many buttons and why are they all into the set i hear auto turrets all right i can i have five c4 i'm down but i could still get up please dude gore is one point confusion one point four g zero points fancy i'm losing again i'm getting sort of deja vu here didn't this happen yeah i feel like this happened already this didn't happen man i don't like it i don't like this feeling you know what i do need to step up my electricity though that's why i reached out to a good friend earlier this week who was able to help me he's a wise man boys and he was able to teach me great things about electricity so i needed some help with electricity traps so i reached out to a good friend of mine mr flack hello fleck we meet again how's it going bro he knows all about electricity trap bases and building tricks and rust so we met in my private server a few days ago to learn some of his tricks i'm just going to build a little bit of a foundation quickly so we can have a place to work so you got like a pressure pad okay and now the pressure pads are cool because when you stand on it it's on and when you get offered it's off yes and the nice thing is they fully hide under oh my god yes that is an insanely useful tool oh my god dude that's so cool flak showed me the importance of pressure pads it's a great way to turn things on and off and the best thing about it is that you can cover it with a rug this is the perfect trick i need that will help me build my next trap base shout out to mr flack do we have a little question for you so uh and i do have a little answer so earlier this week i noticed you were streaming and i asked you porgy can i get your best mama and i know what you said you said no why didn't you give me a mama i didn't get a 10 out of 10 which means which means i've been banished from the mama test let me lay down a little knowledge here what exactly is mama it's a mindset it's a movement you love the compound though right i do well guess what i have a compound build my inventory and i just dropped it to d spawn you want to dig personal i'm digging personal too buddy and he added buddy in there oh yeah yep what are you gonna do well guess what what i'm gonna hit a barrel and not get random items oh my god oh i'm just gonna go and start building my trap you guys for my next trap i'll be building a long one by one hallway and you can literally see the exit right there but the hallway is going to have a bunch of mind games such as empty shotgun traps tons of doors and laser sights the point of the trap is to confuse my victim they'll be focused on the exit but try to avoid each trap in the hallway at the end of the hallway will be two pressure pads that are hooked up to doors they're going to be covered by rugs and once the pressure pad is stepped on the doors will open with shotgun traps oh it's that time again boys this one's from mr flack black don't let me down don't let me down oh oh no you have 60 seconds to solve this why do you have to keep doing these you have six seconds before you die the first digit is 20 times five seconds oh oh now i should probably say i'm horrible at math doing algebra problems and russ was the last thing i was expecting so i don't want to see any comments like wow fancy or really sucks a bath oh what the is this oh my god why do i have to do math why do i have to do math oh my god dude why do you have to make this so hard come on man is zero six six times i'm gonna use a calculator you hurry up man hurry up so that's 100 times four okay four okay four and the last coat is zero no have fun balls what oh no okay if i pass this i'm calling him mr slack from now on okay so door controller what's over here nothing oh i don't like this i i'm just gonna run for it i'm just gonna i'm just gonna go up with a zoom in five four how i'm going already okay okay oh no it's another one of these dude the first thing you always want to do is get the tc ready why is this at one hp just easy okay where is the trap is it a shotgun trap is it an auto turret it's a shotgun trap i see ya here's where i'm gonna big bring you all right aha i see oh that's tweak too that's twig oh i didn't know why i didn't say no dammit dude why'd you have to hit me with these hard-ass algebra problems what it wasn't so hard don't solve the x solve x it's easy i i guess you're sending me back to math class confusion yeah dude i i'll take that l i hate your stupid voice man you're stupid get out all right so the score now is two points poor g one confusion zero female baby it feels pretty good i beat mr mr slack said i'm doing it and now i'm doing it it's my fault man it was mr fleck if you're watching this i'm sorry for failing you dude i feel horrible the hour lesson you gave me was all for nothing i thought i was gonna escape too but uh i didn't expect those land mines to kill me so quickly it is a land mine once you step off it does blow up i don't know if you know that uh thanks fancy orb i really appreciate the advice man i appreciate it man thank you every single trap so far i have gotten confusion stupid ass annoying voice recorders and some stupid that he says with it and so i'm tired of it i want a poor g trap you know i think we switch it up for this next trap right i'm thinking we make it night time and we make a night themed trap what do you guys say that's a little tough spooky we end it at night time and that'll be the finale trap for our last traps nighttime will be enabled so everyone must use lights in our trap to make it even cooler for my trap my victim will be put in a very dark hallway with a switch when they hit that switch slowly lights will be turned on revealing a beard trap maze if they reach the end they escape the maze this is it boys the final swap for the trio series dude my trap the trap is good you're done oh no oh what is this this is what oh my god oh my god all right let's see this boys ah come on come on come on dude your trap is so easy man what is this is this kind of what does this switch do is this supposed to be an oopsie why'd you make it armored doors you just open the little hatches and see what's on the other side oh my gosh let's go now it was my

nVtQTRRWGPo,Can 100 Players Defeat the BEST Rust PvPer?,1418280,26524,1045,0 days 00:12:57,this here is warrior and he is one of the best pvpers in russ in fact he has over 15 000 hours in this game his sprays are insane that he can literally hit every shot as a headshot to prove how insane he is here's a quick 1v1 between us three two one go oh my god dude oh my god was that a double headshot it was a quad as far yeah warrior just beams me with a quad head shot if that doesn't tell you how insane he is i don't know what would but currently there are over 100 players outside this arena waiting to get their hands on warrior today we're going to challenge warrior and see if he can defeat 100 players at the same time but before we get to that we're going to test to see if he can win 1v1s and each player that comes into the arena to 1v1 him will have more hours than the other and every opponent gets to decide the weapon they'll use for the 1v1 warrior let's see if you can be a 500 hour player what weapon would you like to fight warrior with today how much is a tommy i want you to time you were currently versing a 500 hour player sandy with a full spray oh my goodness oh warrior out of nowhere now you are versing an 800 hour player what would you like to fight with today i want yoka slug all right where you're currently versing an 800 hour player with slug and a yokes i bet you have never done this before come on i've not been moscat you guys probably have to get closer for this fight oh my god was that a head shot yeah you are now facing a 1 400 hour player good luck full cat mp5 hollow so where you're currently facing a 1400 hour player oh my goodness already slightly beamed shoopy this is not looking good for you at all throughout this video you'll see warrior doing this tactic it looks like he's hiding behind the barrier but he's actually looking over it without peeking his head it's a strategy you can do in rest where you look all the way down and alt look oh my goodness warrior with the push what's gonna happen get ugly soon oh my goodness oh my god oh there we go in the arena is now a 4 000 hour player now things will get a bit challenging let's do tommy fullmetal warrior you're currently facing a 4 000 hour player we're taking a big bump up so now reversing some people with actual experience oh i didn't expect that you are now versing a seven thousand hour player let's see if you can win this one let's go all right warrior this is also a huge setup you're reversing a 7 000 hour player now we're taking a huge bump up the last person was 4 000. oh my god where did he hit you at all i'm afraid not this is the final boss in the arena is a 9 000 hour player this is your final 1v1 i saw someone get raped by it before but i'll use the mp5 higher all right warrior this is the final 1v1 bus gloom and has 9 000 hours notice how gloomin is using the same strategy as warrior looks like he also knows about it looks like both players did some damage to each other gloomin going for the high ground no one was able to defeat warrior in a 1v1 challenge now that warrior won all of his 1v1s it's time to slowly let the crowd of people into this arena first we're gonna send 10 people and see if warrior can defeat oh them god people are already getting beamed someone stepped on a lot of mine oh no congratulations warrior you have killed the first batch of ten people how hard was that not too bad now let's add 20 people into the arena but give them bows this time can warrior defeat 20 people with bows all at the same time even though there were 20 of them it literally looked like a battlefield with them hiding behind barriers and picking up their fallen brothers and it soon came down to the final three and everyone realized they were doomed now after that devastating round the players outside the arena realized they needed to work together in order to be warrior shut up and listen shut up and listen if we everybody don't run and panic we can attack everybody same second and get him out don't run like this and make a panic he will kill you so be sure to kill him at the same second we start we shoot everybody the same second all right we're gonna do this but their plan didn't go so well after we let 30 people into the arena this time no one's pushing you guys gonna work together work together now it's time to let 40 people into the arena to try to kill warrior listen boys there is only one warrior inside there and i'm looking at 40 brave men are we gonna kill warrior give me a who yeah all right everyone get in the oh room go go go go go warrior you stand no chance against these guys too easy warrior literally turned 40 people into a daycare warrior keeps winning so now it's time to let 60 people into this arena and this time we'll be adding stairs to the center building so people can get up easier my warrior before we do this all right every content creator that joins my videos i give them the mama test you know what that is slap basically i uh have you give me your best memory and we rate it one out of ten it's a one-time deal okay okay we're ready i'd say that's also 7 out of 10. everyone go go go there are 60 of you everyone push out go people are climbing up the stairs and for the first time today warrior was on the run what the there's one more person actually that's where you start warriors where you start always yep yep i'm sorry hopey i'm so sorry warrior you just defeated 60 nakeds now be honest with me how difficult was that one they got me to half hp now when i host my events i keep them very organized because there's over a hundred people and something could easily go wrong but there was a mistake that everyone soon discovered for this event we had a bunch of kits that people could use such as a bow kit a nail gun kit and even a revi kit later in the challenge we were gonna open up these kits for people to use but once one person discovered that these kits were available everyone discovered them and it went horribly wrong when we let 70 people into the arena oh and if you're interested in joining future events like this one for videos join my discord link is in the description oh this is not good where's this guy getting reba from i'm getting peppered by like five rivers what the where they'll get rivers oh it's gonna go pump and they look good they sit naked with rocks updates it's not possible they're winning women remove the kids now it's time to finally release 100 players into the arena and see if the best rust pvper can defeat them take one for the team warrior how are you feeling right now i'm shut out the bed but slowly the 100 players lost their momentum and it was downhill from there dude they were so close man they've lost their momentum it's over the question has finally been answered the best russ pvp can indeed defeat 100 players but let's see what happens when we buff up warrior's health to 1000 hp but we're gonna give the 100 players bows warrior will also be using an m249 which will give him a ton of more ammunition in one clip who do you think will win this one one warrior with an m249 and a thousand hp or 100 players with bows i'm winning this one but nowhere i gotta win this wrong bro dude guys warriors pretty confident he's gonna win this oh my god this is crazy bro that one's a ball god how they hit me i'm dead you guys got it let's go bet you we're not expecting that one were you i'm just getting like hedged like six times instantly now we're going to give 100 players yokas to see if they can still defeat warrior this time warrior was using a silencer so no one knew where he was at first he was able to get at least 15 to 20 kills before people realize where he was oh oh you guys got him holy crap that's it for today but there's a 90 chance you're subscribed so if you made it here in the video and you're not subscribed you should definitely change that also comment down below who i should challenge next and this is warriors twitch go check his streams out,2022-01-31T16:11:36Z
VZo8Ig-64T8,Rust Death Swap 5,463648,8743,194,0 days 00:11:13,in this video me and my friends switch places every 15 minutes and rust and our goal is to kill the other player without attacking them this means we have to set up traps for the other person before we switch places it involves trap bases trickery mind games whatever you can do to get the other player to die this is rust death swap three two one why are you spreading me go go go go go go go go go go go oh my god what did you say hold on hey you squirted me i was spraying you well today is death swap three this is a rematch because no one won the last time yeah all right listen guys all right i'm just gonna cut straight into it all right i studied and i was practicing a ton before we recorded today i'm just gonna say i have a bunch of good traps for you guys and i'm going to win like i i already know like i'm going to outbrain you guys how are you going to outbreak me when i don't have a brain oh my god i'm getting a bunch of rad poisoning oh my god get me out of here now why are you getting red isn't he fancy orb that has to do something with their trap fancy orb oh that's such a good idea radiation trap you know what enough funny business it's time to make my first trap music party yeah dude what is that music was it was it for my first trap i'll be doing version three of the twig foundation trap in episode two there were land mines below and that didn't work in the last episode i put barbed wire barricades blow but that also failed because i forgot to place a tc well this will be the ultimate mind game i'm placing my opponent in a 1x1 with armored walls and a twig foundation and below it will be a metal barricade now when you build a rust if the building is fresh you can break the walls with a hammer as long as you place your own tc i purposely won't place a tc down if one of them notices this they'll try to break any of the walls and behind those walls will be auto turrets you either fall to your death with a twig or fall from my mind games behind the wall oh you're a little bit shy you know what is this this is a new and even more improved version of one of my straps good luck if you get this one before we swapped i noticed porgy was an outpost and right there i knew exactly what his strap was he was banking on the fact that one of us would shoot our weapons which would make a red target appear on us making us hostile and if we were teleported in the outpost the turrets would instantly gun us down wait a second oh here we go here we go here we go all right you have five seconds to make your good luck boys oh my god oh my god oh my god oh no no no oh wait no no please please let's go oh my god there's a turret down there oh my god there's more turrets down there wait hold on i can do this all right please don't tell me oh come on let's go baby confusion your traps nothing on me boy you have five seconds to make your decision oh my god oh my god oh my god oh wait whoa no dude i threw a seat let's go floyd your chat was oh no i'm scared all right do you mind if i uh turn boys so after the first swap it is now one point fancy zero points poor g and zero points confusion wow this is this is different man i'm not used to this oh you're gonna lose man yep wait and see well hey you guys gotta start scoring in fusion you're gonna need a better trap than that man you know what you're gonna need a better um name name you know what's happening is fancy orb yeah that pretty sucks dude pretty good that's your name from this sucker fun fact my xbox gamertag when i was like 10 years old they randomly generated it for me and i've i've stuck with it ever since so you can blame xbox for that if you don't like the name bill gates you suck damn you really got in there you showed him bill gates mom you swallowed i bet you with this trap you will not even know how to do this and you're going to be so confused i bet you guys you don't even know this exists there's a 10 chance you even knew this exists and rust no matter how many hours you have for this trap if you loot anything from the storage box it will automatically open a door and kill you with the right electricity setup if you move take or even put any items in this box it'll trigger a nearby door with an auto turret behind it and kill you it requires this yellow box thingy and it looks very sauce on the box the other guys would know something is up so i'm hiding it behind a door frame so they don't see it found a sousaphone i don't know what sauce a phone saucer phone what's up wait did someone say sus this sousaphone that i just found is gonna be the key to this trap it'll be the perfect bait that i can put in this trap that will trigger the door to open you know i'm gonna keep this sousa phone and it's gonna help me win this challenge today okay i'm gonna give you guys a hint last time confusion i'd give you a note but you didn't even pick it up so this time so this time i will make you very obvious of this time so there's a big sign that says use items in box that will help you so that way you don't you don't forget okay oh here we go boys number two spot number two good luck gentlemen yep good luck to you guys just oh oh my god no i know what this is i know what this is no at this point i realized i was doomed in every video porgie has been in he has trapped a victim in the casting couch and no one has ever survived one in the past this was the casting couch 3.0 please no no make your way through no dude no all right oh what is this oh oh my god make that thing stop make that thing stop wait it's still going what happens when i hit these lasers oh my god no you've got to be kidding me you gotta be kidding me did i just up did i just up oh oh my god oh my god i'm 15 health i'm 15 health oh that was a good trap dude i gotta say good luck gentlemen use the items involved no what i opened what when i clicked on this stupid ass sassophone killed me one of the doors does not have a shotgun trap behind it good luck but this is all there's only one door i only you know i open this and i can the outside i see it yeah you should open it and die yeah it's a little spooked but i have a plan i'm a victim of the cassie couch the cassie couch returns it returns again it's it's it's never not worked it's every time cassie coach is undefeated dude how did you get the land mine to like trick her i didn't even see it you can place it in the floor it's really weird that is insane i need one specific item for my trap if i get it you guys are done oh let's go i got the item oh i can actually start building for the next trap i'll be utilizing the elevators before we swap places i'm going to push the down button which will send the elevator five floors down but when the elevator reaches the bottom shotgun traps will be waiting for my victim the trapped person will only have seconds to quickly think of an escape for this one oh all right guys good luck oh boy have fun oh no no oh why do i hear get me out of this oh my god oh i did have fun oh no oh why don't you get me out of this oh my god oh i did oh good luck have fun oh no get me out of this oh my god did i survived the cardinal work what happened if you're curious what confusions trap was supposed to be he had a c4 attached to a car and he was gonna shoot a broadcaster that was holding up the car the car was supposed to crush and blow me up but unfortunately he didn't do enough damage to the broadcaster all right mr fancy or confusion i need you guys to give me both of you you need to give me one word fart penis okay very mature words that's what i'm basing my trap off of so now i got to figure out how to make a fart penis trap face thank you so much maybe you can make a penis base with yeah fart as in the fire my next trap is very simple so let me show you how it works it's a two by one metal base and the trapped person will spawn on this floor it's completely harmless which should give them time to think but the first thing they'll see is a twig roof which is the key to this trap you see if at any point this twig breaks the whole floor breaks it below our shotgun traps this is because the floor they're standing on is not connected to the base so if they try shooting the twig the floor breaks if they get close to it the floor breaks shotgun traps will be waiting below for an instant death if the floor breaks oh here we go boys oh go school kinda scared guys it's lost oh 63 oh no what is this what is this am i dude how do i get off this well you see it's your worm you don't no wait i can still stand up i can still stand up you're gonna die there's a possibility like oh no i died no i died yep you're right all right come on oh no oh i won i skipped this is the final score so i'm the winner of death swap five if you like this death swap video you'll love the other four so click on the video on your screen to start

death swap episode 2 there was land mines below but confusion barely escaped it whoever gets stuck in my base will have no choice but to break the twig and below will be metal barricades waiting for them oh my god oh my yo i'm sorry for whoever i'm about to do this too i'm so sorry here i i'm going to say this i have done this trap before but it's an upgraded and improved version all right my base oh uh i mean my trap is ready um uh you guys didn't hear that you guys didn't hear that um uh sheesh i'm wondering look at the time what time is it uh 3 33 wow make a wish guys oh oh no well oh all right my hot bar is ready uh i hope you guys enjoy my friends they're very angry oh what what oh oh where am i no oh i'm being attacked oh my god no no no no no no no no no no are you serious are you serious my gun is glitched you know it's upgraded this time so you'll see it has upgrades what are the what are the upgrades though oh wait a second there may be a glitch in the matrix there's high quality walls surrounding you one thing that's twig you have to break that twig oh how do i get off this i'm just gonna wait for the fire to go out i'll just dance oh man so i'm the only one that died so you both have a point and then i just oh yeah yeah yeah dude my gun was glitched how would you even tame it and they chased me i had to chop down a forest for the foundations and then i got like a bunch of balls at the beginning so i just placed them that was good i'll give it to you i'll give it to you but uh hey it's the first of many deaths that will come i just remember what are you doing in uh t9 don't worry about it man someone call me a hunter some call me the shark hunt hey relax man all right since a new confusion was in the water i bought a scuba tank before the swap for my next trap i'm gonna use the mlrs rockets but first i need to make a trap for it i gotta figure out how i'm gonna do this in order for this to work i need to build a 3x3 base with an open roof next i'll need to clear out all the scientists and load in the rockets now this is a complicated process because i need to launch the missiles and somehow get back to the base before the switch happens so when i see the 10 second countdown i'm going to launch the missiles quickly respawn and grab the stuff out of my box all before the switch happens this is gonna be very risky and the timing has to be perfect in order to pull this off there she is she's so pretty i don't know how to use this thing oh what i like this oh my god oh my god do you guys like the lorax have you watched that movie by chance yeah how do you die come on quick he's already died oh what oh no oh what is this dude what is this oh man i was able to respawn just in time before the switch happened but i wasn't able to grab all of my stuff i didn't realize how long it would take for the respawn button to pop up my screen but i got off just in time for the switch and porgie was able to dive to the mlrs rockets he's already died oh what oh no oh what is this dude oh my gosh what is this uh i don't even get off of you oh well i'm dead uh accidentally well no one scored a point that round so it's still one point confusion one point poor g and zero points fancy i'm really i'm really struggling on my own series here that was terrifying i just look up and the first one hit the second one hit and then i was gone oh the hell he just spawned mr confusion huh hi hi what's up this guy you know what else is also up the helicopter yeah the attack helicopter yeah wait is that do you have to do something with that confusion um no maybe are you doing something with the heli bro you're being a little sussy right now for my next trap i'll be using landmines what i'll do is make a long snake of landmines because if one triggers it'll blow up the next one i'll also put metal barricades in a formation so the player i trap won't be able to quickly run away from the landmines oh my gosh what am i doing dude didn't think you'd come down to this but gotta do something you know hey uh orgy yes do you like bacon actually i don't like bacon i'm like one of the only people that i know that don't like bacon this strap would be perfect for you then because this will turn you into bacon okay okay boom yeah you did oh you are near me i'm just practicing my aim i'm sure my hop up okay oh 10 seconds oh god all right all right all right five four three it's working it's working yes yes no alcohol alcohol alcohol that's not a hellcoil huh no what is this i don't like helicopter no yeah no what is this bro wait okay stop stop please what why i was not near fire i wasn't near fire it's working it's working yes yes yes hello no no i think kelly followed me i made a big circle with a bunch of like shotgun traps and flame traps and then lights just looking at a casting couch the cassie coach returns return it's victorious once again in one of my random farming videos poorly trapped one of my teammates and put him in the casting couch here i'll take photo of you in the casting couch yes give me camera i take photo of you in the casting coach yummy yummy the casting champion what the and today the cast and couch 2.0 worked once again movie see casting couch 3.0 in the next video stop with the goddamn baby all right so it is still 1-1-0 since we all died that round no one survived we gotta we gotta make sure this last one is good i got saved by the helicopter your own trap destroyed you turned against me man what the hell i gotta get here from like this why do i hear you yeah my next trap is going to be insane in fact it'll have three levels this one is a jigsaw themed trap so i'll have jigsaw orb explain this one in this trap base there are three levels the first floor has four armor doors and behind each one our shotgun traps above will be an unlocked ladder hatch the track player will have a note that says all crows are five five five five we take the risk and open the doors or we try to go up to escape freedom live or die the choice is yours if the player goes out the ladder hatch there's a laser that will open the doors with an auditor above and above the second floor is another ladder hash that will leave you outside of this trap however there are multiple shotgun traps aimed like the big battles with the trees you know like those trees are you stupid oh my god oh my god no like i know the trees you're like i don't want to hear it wait wait the archer guy i know him the guy yeah you watch him no i know the uh uh the oh the the vikings the long beards you know i know them

jqqRasxuVnQ,"Rust, but I get RANDOM ITEMS from just FARMING",145617,3166,138,0 days 00:09:44,when i hit this doughnut i get a can of beans when i hit this tree i get a stone gate we coded it so anything you farm on this server will give you random items and you have the exact same percent chance of getting any item in this game you could get weapons you could get armor you could even get duct tape wait why is duct tape an item in rest today is a 3v3 team battle with random farming both teams will have a one hour grace period to farm up random items that will help them in this challenge and build up a base then after the grace period pvp and raiding is enabled and the first team to lose their tc loses the challenge but today i'll be getting two guest rust content creators joining me on my team that will be revealed later in this video we have to rely on luck to get really good items from farming so let's see how today goes three two one go go go go go go go go all right tyrande farming once again let's see what kind of luck we can get today so today once again i am starting off solo but i will be getting two more teammates later in this video and the two teammates all beginning will be random rust content creators it might be people you've even watched in the past oh my god no way dude i already got 12 rockets dude that is going to be so good for the rating period later holy it has only been two minutes i already have a bunch of rockets but as i mentioned i will be getting two rust content craters as my teammates and right now i have no idea who it's gonna be but they are up in that mystery box up there right now so right now my future teammates are relying on me to get really good random items since i'm starting off this challenge for my team and i would say i'm doing a pretty good job and just in case you're curious to get resources in this game mode to build up a base you recycle the random items you get but it has been about 15 minutes now so my partner should be coming out first who will be my first teammate a new teammate will now be revealed for each team but on my team i get a rust content creator let's see who's joining today on team fancy sebi k is now on team fancy now look at how beautiful and handsome this man is with a chad like him on our team there is no way we lose this challenge now we introduce sebby k to random farming oh my god oh my god you're savvy i am well and truly excited i've been hiding away i'm good to go well sabi welcome to random farming have you ever done random farming before no i haven't i've only seen you on youtube so literally anything you hit on the server will give you random items in fact i do have a gift for you you know you can use that with some bullets uh right now it's only a one by one with the recycler i've been just saving up uh good items but guess what oh my god wait a second i just got a workbench level three savvy you don't realize this but set workbench level threes are insane in this challenge oh my god you just got one too did we just give workbench level threes at the same time that is crazy also sebby i should mention i did get 12 rockets so we do have a lot of boom to raid the other team now um hopefully you don't mind oh my god did you just blow up i did did you do that for me no i didn't oh my god i think i think the other team placed a landmine over here while i was gone what now sebby i i have to ask you know i i've played with you once but would you call yourself a pvp chad um let me think like there was this one time i killed a guy okay he was afk i am anything but a chad but no i i've got you back don't worry guess what i just got oh i see what's on your back i see it already oh my god let's go baby all right so any second our next rust content creator special guest teammate should be coming out of the box who will it be the second rust content creator joining team fantasy is now coming out of the box brit is now on team fancy now brit actually is familiar with random farming because he's actually made two videos on my random farming servers with another expert on our team we should be able to accomplish big things in this challenge oh my god oh my god oh there we go hello friends hello friends on our team britt welcome to reign of farming i actually know you are familiar with random farming because you've done a couple of videos on my servers i consider myself an expert yes i was i was saying so myself too yeah and then i still present for you here oh oh my god oh no is the present gone oh you need to pick up that box there's a double on the door underneath oh my god that's a good one okay uh let's get that we definitely don't want to lose that right now i have a chainsaw and life is nice with random farming there are a lot of items that you can get that you either forget are in the game or you have no ideas in the game and i could tell these guys were having fun seeing the random items they could get especially 70k what'd you get submarine i don't even think you can place it i got a submarine too oh my gosh oh nothing i decided to go check on the other team to see how they were doing but for whatever reason they were sweating their asses off in this competition oh my gosh the other team is like already has a shooting floor what is this excuse me uh hello i do have something for you guys uh i want you to have a nice drink oh wow that's crazy oh oh thank you for the ak thank you for the ak let's go let's go a common thing in this challenge is to kill another player with landmines since pvp is disabled but the other team completely failed and i was able to snatch a free ak from it and thank you for that uh ak is this the yeah how did that kill me i don't know man but hey thank you for the free ak i'm gonna make our doors the code's going to be one one one one hopefully they don't code radius yeah it's a fair tactic oh that's not cool man that there was smoke grenade in their bruce oh i got c4 i didn't even know oh let's go oh if you guys keep random farming i will build up the base here now every random farming challenge i do the same base design i always make sure there are two entrances to the base in case someone is door camping and inside the base is a garage door with an auditor inside so if the enemy team breaks in we can open the garage door and the turret will gun them down another m2 baby oh that's nice now we started to get a ton of good items but somehow brit went on an insane farming spree and started carrying the team i got empty oh that's good dude we have like three m2s now another m2 oh my are you serious we're gonna be running m2s boys i just got 16 rockets sorry wait you got 16 rockets i got 16 rockets yeah oh my god brick you're insane what the hell you're insane we brought you in for something right right yes dude you're doing good man you're doing good you've got another m2 did you get another one oh my god yeah oh and uh i'm an l9 we've got another m2 another m2 are you bridge that's like your seventh one today all right pvp is now enabled boys good luck we got this the enemy team immediately launched an attack on our base and caught us off guard oh my god triple hedge hold on hold on yellow flag on the plane clearly with the triple mp5 headshot that guy should have been dead i beamed his ass which is rare for me to say but let me tell you that he didn't even lose half his health and here is why in random farming you can get the bandit suit gear which is what he was wearing but what you can also do is wear a metal face mask over and stack your gear you can also stack other gear like roadside kilts making you nearly invincible with this strategy he had 80 protection from my weapon 42 you took 42 damage three mp5 headshots with this only did 42 damage referee fancy now declares the other team was cheating during this challenge but let's continue the video and see how things play out we're getting door caps on both of our doors here we go yeah killed one there's there's one more out there's one more out by the pool another pool okay this is this is our opportunity to push back oh you just killed sebby whoa oh my god bro sorry man you're freaked uh brits are chad bro all right i can kill some but after they killed us again they started to raid once more this have gone any worse i know dude this is so bad well boys this is it they were in our main loot room so i had a final standoff yeah they got all of our loot boys but 70k had an incredible clutch moment in this challenge watch this nice oh he's still alive oh let's go see you soon over it's not over i'll try to cover outside i just put a key lock on we sealed it off right now oh my gosh good boys should we just quickly run over and launch a raid attack yes we just grab grab all the rockets we gotta go we gotta do this now we're gonna rocket launcher it's now we're never good this was our one moment to attack so sebby and brit started raiding men i'm in their base you say you're in i'm in no sense the other team left all of their doors open so we were one door away from tc but unfortunately they double teamed sebby after that the other team came over to our base and since we had nothing left to fight they took our tc team fancy loses this one also if you want to try out random farming for yourself i have three random farming servers for you to play just search fancy warp under the modded section or connect to the ips below,2021-12-31T16:59:57Z
h_6SDx3O7dc,So I Created the First Rust Christmas Zerg...,102984,3559,241,0 days 00:13:08,merry christmas and happy holidays to everyone to celebrate the holidays i gathered 200 people in my discord and we created the christmas zerg what is the christmas zerg you ask i told all of my members to change their name to elf and a four digit code right after it that way if you see another player with elf in their name you know they are a friendly zerg member also throughout this video you'll see me give out tons of reskins to all the good elves who belong on the nice list to get on the nice list all you have to do is contribute to the zerg this could be by giving me resources giving me guns anything to do to help the zerg out today i have a beautiful christmas story of the rise the fall and the rise again of the first ever russ christmas zerg and i should mention we are less than 1 000 subscribers away from 100k if you haven't subscribed yet now is literally the best time to do so our adventure starts on an official server we first needed to find a nice place to build elves once you're in go ahead and start looking for an area to building i think i may have found an area though our first goal was to build a massive log cabin house to store all the elves we were gonna decorate it with christmas trees snowmen and all sorts of decorations to get everyone in the christmas spirit and we actually have a checklist of things we want to accomplish for our zerg the first thing is to build a large cabin house for our home next the elfs will line up and tell fancy claws what they want for christmas after that we'll tell stories around a campfire and then we'll have the biggest snowball fight rust has ever seen next we'll go seeing christmas songs and go find a base to christmas carol too and finally wrap it up with a fireworks show we have big plans today for the zerg but with hundreds of people contributing we should be able to accomplish everything on our checklist oh boys boys i found our home the official area where we are going to build our log cabin is l5 we found a huge area to build it and now it was time to create the cabin house we're all going to say elf zerg one two three go elf zerg oh my god oh my god dude yo there are so many of us oh i'm over here i'm over here i'm over here oh my god i got a hazmat all right alph one two zero one you're getting a skin baby thank you for the hazmat elf one two zero one all right boys let's go farm boys everyone farm up go go go we're gonna attack that forest boys everyone go off on that forest and so we did everyone started farming wood at a nearby forest to put it towards the house watch out boys i'm gonna expand the base here we go here we go 782 can i have that jackhammer i'll give you a skin for that jackhammer thank you thank you everyone dropped me a ton of wood it was looking like we were going to make fast progress on our first task on the list i've never seen this much wood in my life all right oh my goodness all right who is that l5767 you're getting a skin that's a lot of wood but that was when one of the elves gave me their hatchet and something was off about it wait hold on everyone i got mason you don't have a skin for this hatchet well mason if you can farm five trees behind me before i finish talking about today's sponsor i'll give you a brand new hatchet skin let's go baby hell yeah today's video is sponsored by rust clash flash is a rust case opening site so you can get new skins for rust the cool thing about this site is that they have something called rain which is literally free money it's a pool of money evenly distributed to everyone on the site every 30 minutes they also have game modes such as case openings case battles and upgrader also if you have a high rank on their leaderboards you also get free skins now if you want to open free cases on this site all you have to do is use code fancy and you'll get three crates to open let's go i finished baby congratulations mason i'm sending you over that skin right now oh thank you thank you thank you oh my gosh you're awesome elf two two three four you're getting a skin we were halfway done with building the massive log house but then we met our first enemy coming focus on focus on building up the village boys oh my god oh my god what's happening what's happening what's happening else you need to sacrifice your life you need we were being attacked two geared men in a minicopter were shooting flame rockets towards our base and burning the log house and all of the elves oh my god oh my god oh my god what is that oh my god oh my god they're they're attacking us oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god we're being burned now after a few rockets the geared players left but they were definitely placed on the naughty list now we were able to get more progress done on our base oh the village is looking good boys the village is looking good here we go anyone everybody have wood come on in come on in oh my god oh my god all right is that one here aboard anyone here avoid oh my god do you have the mp5 280 oh my god elf 2805 you're on the nice list you're getting a skin for that oh my god there's a hot air balloon up there is that us is that us in the higher balloon and soon we were finally able to finish our house guys we are almost done boys we're almost done with the final face next we needed a secure way for the elves to give us their loot all right boys we're gonna expand outside a little bit okay so back away from the door do not come in or else my security guard will shoot you okay so we established a trading center with a shop front at the entrance the elves were able to easily trade their loot with us without having it stolen this was a great way to keep the elves organized there you go there you go that's what i want to see boys make a line at the window nice nice nice nice nice oh christmas tree nice oh my god okay okay elf two two four nine except except all right elf two two four nine you're getting a skin after that one that was that was really good oh my god i hear a car outside did we get a car oh my god we got a car somehow oh my god all right nice the zerg was strong and everyone was now working together however some christmas stories don't have perfect endings you see there were some people on that server that day that were on the naughty list uh oh my god no wait someone on that server completely wiped out our log cabin house with mlrs rockets in one swift move our elf zerg was shattered right in front of our eyes everything we put together in this space was lost in an instant the wood the decorations the trade window everything wiped out in a second this was horrifying for us and i was shocked i didn't know what to do i sat in my chair and watched the decaying remains of what used to be our home oh my god you gotta be kidding me dude no way oh my god no way dude i'm sorry ladies and gentlemen christmas has been ruined and our story ends here psych you thought we were gonna let a couple bozos defeat our christmas spirit yeah obviously it sucks to get mlrs rocketed by our christmas spirit was still through the roof so i gathered all the elves and we went on my own rust server to finish everything we wanted to check off our list ladies and gentlemen our story still continues and i won't waste your time with building a new log cabin house so instead we'll cut right into it the next thing to do on our checklist was to line up all the elves outside and have them ask fancy claws what they wanted for christmas what would you like for christmas first of all what would you like for christmas you know no one's ever asked that you know for christmas i do want to hit 100k subscribers so if you're not subscribed already make sure to do so because we are closing in on 100k hello l4201 what would you like for christmas this year i'd like to give you something for christmas oh okay what do you want to give to me oh my god oh oh my why do you have so i'll be able to give it to all the rust families who who need beach tables yo everybody clap if you need beach tables boys clap if you need beach tables all right yeah see you you're gonna you did a great service for all these people here l four two zero what do you want for christmas one four three two might be a lot but a furnace again you know what l432 i think we can make that happen i'm gonna give you a furnace skin go to the third floor upstairs go go go go everybody's in the third floor to the third floor all right keep that there boys on the first floor there's a rocket launcher first person to find it gets a skin go go go go go there's a rocket launcher secretly hidden around here first person to fight is going to get a skin where is it oh someone got it elf six nine one one six nine one one you're getting a skin on your screen the next thing they do on our list was to gather around and tell christmas stories it was a peaceful moment to just sit down and relax however the stories weren't so good one day there were 100 little the next thing on our checklist was to go christmas caroling but as we were getting ready one of the elves had a question for me fancy yeah can you gift me right for christmas a rock skin a rock skin yeah i can you want it right now yeah all right back give me a second this is your rock all right i'm gonna send that to you later okay oh my god now he was definitely happy after receiving that skin we found a base to go christmas caroling too so we headed over with a zerg and started singing ready set jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way oh going keep going keep going so let's say hey guys try your best to sing try your best to sing uh what about rudolph robert rudolph rudolph the red nosed reindeer go go go yeah christmas caroling didn't go as planned and in fact it was the worst singing i've ever heard to be honest i don't know why i was expecting russ players to be able to sing christmas songs but we're just gonna move on what is going on this is horrible this is so horrible we had to kill all the elves unfortunately but it was okay because they were gonna spawn back at the village we created because now it was time to do our snowball fight we had the biggest snowball fight ever in rust and it was the most wholesome thing to watch although some people were throwing more than just snowballs and for some reason some people brought guns to the snowball fight but we're just gonna ignore those overall the zerg was happy and everyone was having a great time the last thing to do on our checklist was to light off tons of fireworks to wrap up our christmas adventure all the elves gathered around the village and it was a beautiful sight to see the colorful fireworks lighting up the homes below we even lit off 100k firework as i'm closing in on a hundred thousand subscribers oh oh dead so good dude oh man this could be the video that gets me to 100k by the way man this this could be it even though today didn't go as planned we still managed to check off everything on our christmas list and ladies and gentlemen we are less than 1 000 subscribers away from 100 000. if you haven't done so already now would be the best time to do so i hope everyone has a safe holidays and thank you for watching today's video,2021-12-25T16:00:30Z
-LU8T0j1PxU,"Rust, but Farming Gives RANDOM ITEMS (BUT WITH A TWIST)",107315,2939,168,0 days 00:11:29,today we're playing rust but we coded it so anything you try to farm will give you random items

team challenge this is how it goes there are two teams and we have a one hour grace period to farm up whatever random items we can get during this stage we also have to build up a base and place a tc down after the grace period we can raid in pvp the first team to destroy the enemy tc win but there is a twist this is the box now in this challenge it'll start as a 1v1 and every 15 minutes i get a new teammate that comes out of the box and my teammates are special guest rust content creators they can literally be any of your favorite rust content creators that you watch on youtube or twitch

it's the bar marina marina that sounds epic i'm pretty hungry i'm pretty hungry the grace period was about to be over and we needed a base design fast now confusion suggested making a piano space confusion is a very good interior designer made sure there are peaks in the balls just in case we get raided hopefully this base would hold an attack the balls are looking nice man good thank you very nice clothes boys pvp rating is now enabled we immediately pushed the other team in hopes for a quick raid once but after our team got picked off we had to go on to the defense because now the other team was about to raid us uh he went to the stonewall oh he's going in the back oh he's trying to swing left i see them that's that way he's dead he's dead i'm dead i'm dead yeah it's fancy dude confusion had a plan oh you know what i'm just gonna sit in the hot air balloon hold up he was gonna hide in a nearby hot air balloon for a surprise attack and sinks was behind some wood piles outside our base the other team was not going to expect this counter at all uh what's outside the wood walls kill two what's outside the woodwork right outside our basement now with all the explosives it was time to launch our final attack while sinks and confusion were blowing into the base i was camping on a nearby cliff to give extra support from the skies oh nice nice guys kill him in there i'm

nstJpVogzLY,"Rust, but Farming Gives You RANDOM ITEMS",170474,4384,134,0 days 00:10:02,today we're playing russ but we coded it so anything you farm in this game will give you random items when i hit this note it gives me a campfire when i farm this tree i get an m249 you can literally get any item in this game from just farming today i'm with my friends and we'll be competing in a challenge this is how it works it's a 2v2 competition and we have one hour to farm up whatever random items we can get and build up a base after the one hour grace period we can raid in pvp when you destroy the other team's tc you win we have to rely on good luck in rng to get really good items from random farming so let's see how this goes and i should mention there's a 12 chance you're subscribed to me if you're not you definitely should because we're trying to hit 100k before 2022. three two one go go go go go go go oh oh oh let's go let's go let's go are you ready to win today yes all right this is gonna be easy oh my god i already got a workbench level three what i i just got insanely lucky throughout the random farming videos the hardest thing to get is a tier three workbench and i got it on my second hit in this competition the reason why these things are so important is because it's impossible to save up scrap to craft it now we can craft explosives for the raiding period later in this video no especially everything you realize how big that is you know what you do oh my got god m39 with rifle bullets super eating good already dude i'm too fancy oh my gosh shoot it shoot we gotta flex to them ready oh dude they've gone oh it's over and i'm gonna i've never had such a great start so far like let's go i got a jackhammer it has only been three minutes in this competition we also got a jackhammer which is extremely good in random farming so instead of normally farming which is pretty slow using a jackhammer will give you random items at a really fast pace the same thing also goes for a chainsaw yeah oh my god i got an mp5 dude i have a thompson m39 np5 this is all for my first hit i haven't even like doored anything away do you know the reason why i chose you for this challenge why fancy because i know you are a pvp chad and i know we're gonna get this easy dub today okay i've seen your play and you're a beamer my guy okay so i expect a lot of things out of you today oh yeah that's good i need oh okay i got a supply signal i don't i can't remember if they're good or bad on the server so we're going to find out together if we get into their base and we're looking at them i can score them with a water gun oh my god we're going to sport them oh c4 baby let's go i got test generator too so we if we just get an auditor we can set up now is the test generator give me a c4 test generator an auditor and like a large furnace to recycle like dude this is the most op tree ever this is the best start in like any arena farming video i've ever done dude i'm gonna go to the other team and uh and see how they're doing i have i have a cowbell thing if we want to run over there yes hey boys we have a two year three we have a tier three we got love and appreciation you know in their vc they went yeah they have a tier three or air drops here if you want to check it out oh yeah all right let's go let's go oh wait that's actually cool okay all right air dropping oh dude that's so huge oh my god oh my god life is good dude life is so good oh i got an ak yeah just let's go do you want that yeah you should probably toss me the ak because my ak

congratulations spency here is your ak skin you want you want to go check in on them again and see what they got let's do a little scouting scouting business all right let's go let me uh he's got an m to it and a chainsaw oh they got chainsaw now i'm about to hit the biggest diabolical lick of the century the other team was peacefully farming but george's inventory was full and for whatever reason he was letting all the items fall onto the floor now watch what happens next i'm looking i'm looking devil's throw also has a chicken oh my god oh my god oh my god dude his inventory was full and he was hitting the chainsaw and rockets fell out of the tree dude i got 13 rockets i stole his 13 rockets you grabbed this 13 rocks oh my god we just yawned rockets holy dude that's so huge bro oh broken dude do they even know i don't think he even noticed dude dude our area is so dry dude we don't have any treasures yeah we just it all through is coming over to our section and getting our trees what is with them man they have their own trees i mean hey we did steal like yeah that was their something that a lot of rust players don't realize is that washed up wood can also be farmed in this game but for whatever reason we discovered that they're extremely op and we got really good random items out of them oh we got 8x 8x really oh can i have that of course yes oh my god dude that these wood piles are goated i just got a c4 m39 thompson 8x spazz oh yeah i didn't think about those l96 from them holy nice these wood piles are goaded as oh i got another l9 out of the beach pile dude i'm telling the beach piles they're like oh p what the hell what the heck it's horrible oh oh oh my god his own landlines yeah the other team accidentally blew themselves up with landmines so we knew they were up to something i was just casually building up our base until i heard something oddly suspicious oh my gosh i got a grenade launcher also what are you guys doing over here i heard a noise over here uh what was that you want to explain i i don't know what you're talking about i see something in this bush talking about wait uh they're placing landmines in there we can shoot them yep that's what i'm doing they're placing hella landmines in these bushes watch yourself with a few minutes left in the grease period we finished up our base we saved up all the auto turrets we farmed and placed two outside of our base and it's a good thing we did because soon you'll see how effective they were all right pvp is now on spencer are you ready to do with this yes i'm ready all right pvp and rating is now enabled should we go out and uh scout do a little scouting business i'm ready yeah all right dude could also utilize lighthouse too hood in lighthouse with an m2 dude their base is so come over here bro right now why are there boxes out in the open and why is there why is the recycler not in their base i'm gonna look at their chest over here okay dude they have a bunch of in here dude i'm just gonna take it oh my god dude look at these all right make sure you're holding that door yeah i'm looking around too something's outside something's outside someone's outside okay okay towards the front yep he's done good good good call i didn't hear that at all okay i'm gonna blow this this might be like all the boom we have fancy we were blowing through their armored base but it was using up all of our explosives we didn't have much left either so we needed a tc or else we would be out but then they started raiding us oh they're ready wait they're reading us wait that's all right we're good we're good we're good we're good yeah quickly go go go go go mommy run back yeah go back go back i'm gonna hold our turn shooting them okay yep you got him again all right i'm gonna go back and get that boom shooting them yep nice let's go dude our turrets from earlier worked and actually stopped the raid at this point we were out of explosives though so we needed something good off their bodies and hoped they would have explosives on them dude if they had boom on them this would be huge yeah 15 rockets 15 minutes oh my god oh my god oh my god bring it just bring oh and the rocket launcher oh yeah yeah it's this one right here fancy it's the square room so go back go back outside go back outside here take rockets all 15. i see i see him running back his little weasley

way if you want to try out random farming for yourself we actually have servers for them now if you search fancy orb under the modded servers on rust you'll find all my random farming servers there's

pjbIXMEXtfk,Rust Last to Leave the Circle Wins $100.00,508004,10578,385,0 days 00:30:37,the last person to leave this circle and rest is winning a 100 skin if you step out of the circle you're eliminated if you don't move your character for 30 seconds you're eliminated and every one hour will do a challenge and if you fail to complete it you're eliminated i don't care how long this takes we're going until there's one person left in this circle and i should mention there's a 12 chance you're subscribed to my channel so if you're not definitely change that because we're closing in on 100k before we start everyone is getting one item of their choosing to help them in this challenge i want a piano can i get a megaphone bro i'd like a flamethrower please i want a golden egg let's see what you get oh my gosh i would like a c4 an 8x i also got a good band practice so i'm gonna trump it all right boys so the challenge has officially started you guys cannot leave this circle if you do you are eliminated the challenge has officially started let's ask some questions to the players all right so commando who do you think is gonna be the first person that's going to be eliminated from this challenge who do you think it's going to be honestly i think it's uh daiko the clown over here oh papa ski who do you think will be eliminated first okay well it sure as hell not brock because he's got snacks to survive the apocalypse we got one can of pringles two candle pringles a bag of chips whole bag of variety tops oh my god gummy bears but why did you choose a sea farm very curious like something with that like what's up you blow up that piano i punch and just five minutes into this competition i realized that this was going to be a very long challenge so and it seemed like the contestants were using psychological warfare against each other in hopes they would leave the circle you know this is psychological warfare i don't want to be here dude you guys doing this to me too remember that i actually have a form of chip on my desk right now if someone can correctly guess what the chip is you guys get an extra item of your choosing i think you have a bag of delays salt and vinegar pringles it it it is pringles though daiko unlocked uh unlocked to guess what flavor is the crunch i don't know if it's gonna fit but can i have an above ground pool please but then out of nowhere something horrible happened and what you're about to see no one saw coming i robbed your piano i have oh my god oh my god well that just ruins the fun wait stop now did you catch that commando was very close to stepping out of the circle and brock swear he saw him step out so we went over the footage together to see if he was eliminated that's clear all right commander go ahead and make an adventure come on though come here come here i didn't realize i was that close but it's okay i'm not i'm not upset i really do want brock to win i feel like brock's got the upper hand i think brock's got it it is official commando is eliminated he's out of the discord he's out the rust server like when you get eliminated you're out of everything oh my god one by one people will be picked off yes five thousand followers oh and whoa it's a lot quieter without commando here we'll say that so it doesn't seem like these guys are budging right now like they are they are pretty set we did get one elimination thank god it was commando he was getting very loud but i think it's time to introduce our first elimination challenge all right boys so it has been about one hour into this challenge how are you guys feeling right now you're feeling all right you guys you guys you guys still feel like you guys can you guys can go a couple more hours yeah he's gonna be still okay all right well we are going to do our first elimination challenge so someone somewhere in this circle will be walking out here very soon it's time to get into the first elimination challenge it's very simple i spawned in a bunch of npcs and each player has one shot to kill the npc with a bow it must be a direct headshot no body shots are allowed the person who fails to do this will be eliminated every single one of you has to hit a headshot and kill the npc if you miss going to be eliminated when you're ready you can take your shots oh sen hits the first shot bluff hits him all right you can take your shot when you're ready oh gekko you can take your shot when you're ready oh on my screen i have a chance you can take your shot when you're ready how does he have this much ammo oh owen is saved papa is safe has been eliminated in that circle behind you who do you think is going to win i'm not confident any of them i'd say that hemp seed in the ground all right boys that is the second person eliminated there is five people left now after every elimination challenge i allow the players to select one item of their choosing and what they're about to request i was not expecting at all zen what would you like your item to be i want a recycler give it to us but you're placing it down for us come on all right i'll give you a recycle i'll give you a recipe all right there's your recycler i would like a stone gate what are you guys up to all right stop just give me my stone gate fancy pop this key what would you like your items what am i getting what am i getting the wood one you're getting the wood one uh wooden gate all right yeah oh my god what are you guys doing with these give me the belts give me the builds give them a little give them a little i'm very curious on what you guys are doing this is interesting oh my god oh my god don't make it too big yeah yes yes i need more wood give me one more give me more wood to my surprise the contestants were actually working together instead of choosing items to help them in this challenge they requested big items like stone gates so they could recycle them into stone to build a base this is unacceptable i need these players to be against each other they're competing for a hundred dollars this can't be a friendly challenge so it's my goal to slowly tear them apart i got an offer for you guys i have an offer all right you guys said you guys want chairs yes all right i want to run a chair i will give you a challenge okay if owen hits the npc shot from the same distance i will give you guys five chairs if he misses the recycler's gun oh no no pass pass looking team shot look at him look at him so is this something you want to do owen i think i could do it i think i could do it i believe in you okay you've got this guys all right owen you could say when you're ready let him focus oh look on the bright side we have a house right now so it seems like these guys are having a little fun they use their big brains to actually come up with a house i was not expecting this is very impressive but we're giving them a little surprise everybody uh can i have your attention please please stand on the ramp on the ramp you know this challenge is gonna have uh roadblocks we'll see uh so today we're going to present our first roadblock right here is a landmine all right oh man if you land on it and you blow up you're eliminated but you cannot work together to remove it that should be fine that should be fine if you give me the full meadow i will risk my life oh oh oh you realize you guys could be perfectly fine as long as you just avoid those like you guys there's a clear path you guys can take placing two landmines in the circle was going to be an issue for the players but sin was going to risk his life to remove them one hundred dollars is on the line to save the group is it worth it watch out pick our nation watch out papa watch out i have an idea oh my god you're not going to outplay me bro with the amount of experience you have the most hours here dude what challenge you have son 7 000 oh geez nelson boys i'm gonna stop typing in team chat with the next game plan is i think i'm like i can't believe you guys are teaming up again you guys are supposed to work against each other you guys we're trying to eliminate each other push each other off the edge and now you guys are working together what is this your family and your family yeah we got a house with the piano and nothing else i'm gonna give one person a five dollar skin if you step out of the circle right now offer was there this experience is worth more than five dollars it's true we're a family now i can't believe that i can fast five crew this is not fair no this is not fair this is five years old family man the group is now calling themselves a family and together the five of them were teaming up against me now i don't know what their plan is with this family because eventually one by one they'll slowly be eliminated but i had to pull out sneaky tactics in order to separate them my first plan was to call in helly on this server and since we're in a tiny one grid map it'll come straight to us they're all wearing armor too so the heli will instantly open fire let's see if plan number two works take your gear off two pieces of gear on only head and chest you son of a stop shut up did not work contestant sen once again ruined my plan because sen has over 7 000 hours in russ it's going to be difficult to out brain this group in fact it seemed like sen was leading this group to victory he helped defuse the land mines he heard the heli and avoided the group being attacked sen was the clear leader of this group and was keeping everyone together oh yeah so guys i got a question do you guys think if commando or slimer here you guys would do the whole family thing slime we'll see how you guys do with family in uh 20 minutes when we do our next elimination challenge one person from your family will die dude you guys will be picked off one by one it'll be juicy to see for me eventually you guys will break up and shatter so just i can't start i'll start a tiny little cabin in heaven for you guys all right everybody we're going to do our next elimination challenge are you guys ready oh no okay challenge number two is a simple rock throwing challenge each player will throw a rock outside the circle and whoever's rock is closest to the circle will be eliminated so you want to throw your rock as far as possible go ahead and throw your rock when you're ready good luck oh oh and the tumble dude so this is where this is where you're rocking oh and that cannot go as far so that means sen is completely safe he will be moving on place this all right you may throw in your brother look up papa look up this is for family oh oh oh unfortunately that is not past blood damn it higher isn't further higher isn't further keep that in mind owens gets a pass and he is safe sen owen and bluff are safe it's down to papa and brock one of you are going to be eliminated if you get it past the green sun then that means you're safe you may throw when you're ready oh goodbye gentlemen sorry say your goodbyes in your final send-off before you walk off the circle all right gentlemen who's been involved lasted two hours in there man i have those people in that group who do you think is going to win you know what i know everyone's probably said it but i'm gonna say brock i have faith in him you know he got the snacks already snacks on deck i'm gonna have to go with brock i'm sorry i say goodbye to family say goodbye to family you're sick i'll start a tiny little cabin in heaven for you guys so since papa was brutally murdered instead of disconnecting we're gonna put a pookie beard down in his memory so that'll be him over here no he this goes with the losers because papa's a loser so boys it is hour two uh we are going to go over uh new items that you guys can request so owen what is your item that you'd like i would like a recycler that's good right i would like a stone high wall gate i would like a tier 3 workbench i would like to win turbine now although papa ski was eliminated the group is still sticking together as a strong family so it's time to introduce plan number three to separate them i'm going to spawn in the scientists near the circle that'll shoot the contestants they don't have any weapons to defend themselves so let's see if this plan works scientist oh cheetah here's what i need you to do right now uh careful it's fine it's fine we're okay everything's okay i need you to recycle those tight gloves and bring me the rope asap bro actually no i'm gonna do some i'm gonna get a circle he's in the circle the color is a twig oh my goodness no way i mean if you need an arrow i have one oh he's madden bro hard bro oh my gosh and we also got a cute anime door hell yeah once again sen has ruined my plan and was carrying this group to victory i gotta ask you is it different without papaski here your family member like it's tough but we still have family we've still got family man it's gonna suck to see your family get picked off that's that's the hard thing you know you'll be at everyone's funeral but no one will be at yours ah come on impressive i saw him i was so now for the final 30 minutes nothing was really happening it's been about three hours into this competition but something completely unexpected happened i was answering some emails but listen to what the players are about to say man what do you guys think the next challenge is yo look at that man brock ross yeah what's up did you see us you could open the door oh you know this this door yeah you can't see our door you sure yeah i see no door yeah i'm looking around i don't i don't see it i don't see it hey owen boost me here real quick brock appeared to betray family and place a key lock on the door so the other players couldn't get in the house this was completely unexpected there was a betrayal in the circle and the players didn't appear so strong together after all i was amazed to hear this because i've been trying to separate them for the last hour but let's see how the other players feel about this brock i'm ashamed in you what happened to family huh welcome to family man you did brock between the family man character the character get out i lied to you guys i got more than 200 wood from the windmill always standing in the back window bars can i use the hammer that way you kind of pick it up so i turned my back on family oh you are not family you are you kick him out the team bro you guys have been your backstage me this entire time i'm not angry i'm just disappointed after witnessing this devastating betrayal i wanted to interview some of the players in a private voice call to hear what their thoughts were how are you feeling about brock right now like give me give me your thoughts on this i am going to make him regret every single thing he's done oh that's a promise i know you are the most experienced player here you have over 7 000 hours so i know you have something ready for him why did you uh get rid of your family here like why did you do this they were never family so they got my brother out i turned my back on family because i don't need family oh i never needed family no really is that the case because i'm pretty sure family was the one that told you how to throw your rock further well i also sabotaged papa i told him to aim higher knowing you'll drop fart like not as far look up papa look up burn are you savage i'm cleaning oh my god brock has been playing you guys the whole time and you guys lost all your progress everything you worked up for what happened to the piano in the tier three you guys lost all your items too oh my god brock is the player after about another 20 minutes the other three players were working together to make sure brock's time in the circle was miserable before the next elimination challenge no we're both stuck here so you're just sabotaging i can just walk off i can just walk off whatever you know i'm caring for my family man oh my god so you're gonna keep them there do you think your family's gonna care for you yeah man um they're not like you who's to say that sen isn't just using you and that me and son are trying to big brain something so you guys are just going to keep him in jail yeah man is there any negotiation brock can do to let you guys let him free take the key lock off the door yeah okay i don't believe him now to spice things up a bit i offer the group a challenge if one person could headshot an npc with a compound bow i'd give the group another item of their choosing but if you miss the circle loses the recycler so does anyone want to take that i'll take that that was the chest shots whole family we're all secretly snakes just i'm the one that's not scared to admit it it's it's sad to see how you guys are progressing and now it's downhill you guys lost all of your stuff stop here i'm gonna go over here i'm gonna say roof it's time to get into the third elimination challenge this time there's no skill involved to make it fair for the group it's complete rng i'm placing a spinning wheel with four colors and it's very simple if the wheel lands on your color you're eliminated now there are high stakes right now if brock's eliminated the group is happy once again because brock is the one who betrayed the group if sen gets eliminated the family is in deep trouble as sen was leading the group to victory this entire challenge and if bluffer owen is eliminated the family gets smaller oh no oh no whoever this lands on is going to be eliminated it's me oh my gosh owen and bluff that was actually probably the worst outcome for you guys because sen was your leader he was helping you guys all right everybody please say goodbye to sen all right goodbye my man has been eliminated i feel i feel betrayed man i don't know who do you think is going to walk away with the 100 prize if it's skill burst it'll be bluff if it's something else i reckon i want to win i really don't think brock's going to win i think they're going to do everything in their power to try and keep him away from it brock if i see you in another one of these events i will never ever ever trust you and i will do everything in my power to make sure that you lose that event and sen is gone is now down three people all right so we are going to do items now you guys can choose any item that you guys would like so we'll start with bluff what item would you like we could rebuild a new house we could rebuild a new house together without sun will you have for i don't know man i don't i don't particularly trust him man he hasn't even said sorry i am sorry for betraying you boys sun was just trying to master mind i didn't want him to win if you're watching this i still love you i respect you he does not love you at all you'll see his interview and i will do everything in my power to make sure that you lose that event all right guys it's time to do items so you guys got 30 seconds uh each time someone says is that good a high external wooden gate please external stone gate take the door and the lock off and toss them outside of the circle all right you guys could recycle those for extra reasons yeah we could let's actually get gold man the vibe has completely changed without sin and there we go oh yeah it seemed like after sen was eliminated the remaining three players were rebuilding the family with their new items they rebuilt the house and things were starting to form again this is the new era for the circle look there we go we're a family again boys okay we're family it might not be a perfect house but it's a house it's cool to see the build-up the downfall and then the re-establishment the new age yeah the new age the scene the best of the situation we've been given their new family was going strong until this happened wow wow oh what did i miss look at him look at him oh my gosh yeah he's still together i'm gonna drop me the resources or am i gonna unlock the store and throw it out of the circle again you want my 100 wood i want all your resources yo you want the five claws everything including all the way down to your armor training family again man what brock just remember any new family so brock just locked the door and it's forcing bluff to give him everything he has i want everything you have don't do it man don't do it you're not getting out of here brock did it again oh my goodness man this is how you treated a teammate you know you guys never invited me back into the family because you've already got the team man not really all right you know what just stop me just yeah yeah exactly exactly you could stay in there right that's fine yeah just because you want the money i see i don't want no money oh so you two are going to win and take the skins right that's what you two want i'm going to test fancy to keep his skin donate 100 bucks to mental health awareness and i'll match his 100. if i win okay i will put 250 pounds which is over a hundred dollars i'll put 250 pounds into a charity of fancy's choosing challenge number four is a game of hide and seek i'm hiding two nails somewhere in the circle and if you find the nail you're safe the player who does not find a nail will be eliminated your time starts now owen found the first one it's between brock and blow since owen found both nails it's now down to brock versus bluff first to find the next nail winds so owen is definitely safe so it's between bluff and brock let me hide the nail add an extra tip where is the single nail anywhere in the circle has on the last family of the two of those guys i asked the same question everybody who do you think is going to win in that circle i want owen to win but i think it's going to be brock oh everyone's been saying that dude love has been eliminated to two people i've got like five stacks of pumpkins on me there you go man for family this has been one hell of a rocky ride there have been many events we've just got to share our final moments as family man i will pop open my pringles my sour cream and onion pringles right now i'm down to toast to some sour cream and onion pringles supposed to have a sour cream on your pringles boys it's so peaceful man just look how far we've come man it was crazy the first round first two rounds everyone was screaming at each other and then it was all family and it was not family and then it was fake family and now it's like best friends it seemed like these players were not leaving the circle anytime soon so we decided to do the next challenge painting both players will have 5 minutes to draw their best fancy orb image and the person with the best painting was going to win but i wasn't going to be the one to judge the paintings in fact i'm going to bring back every player who was eliminated in this challenge and let them vote whichever painting has the most votes wins brock and owen have no idea i'm bringing back every eliminated player while they were talking i was secretly messaging everyone on discord to come back so this would be a complete surprise to both of them both these are this this is good this is really funny too i'll do i love both of them you guys are here to help decide the final challenge oh hell yeah so okay up to you guys to decide which image you would like and the judges will have no idea which painting is whose and i made owen and brock's screen share on discord so they couldn't message anyone which painting was theirs painting number one is owens drawing and painting number two is brock's drawing now it's time to vote all right son hello one you want to go one yeah all right commando uh one of course you're gonna go with one yeah one's a good drawing buff toppers one or two i'm gonna go number two that go hello okay oh he says two if he's not back all right sounds good it was a tie two points owen two points brock but there was one more person left to vote this final vote decided who wins this competition all right papa ski you have a very important decision to make which painting has your vote all right well it was a it was a tough decision you're both beautiful but i'm gonna have to go with gentlemen it has been six hours in this circle and it's finally time to finish this challenge i've casted all the votes and i will say this was a very close decision in fact the player who has the most votes won by one single vote the winner of the first last to leave circle video on my channel is brock brock it's time for you to leave the circle owen goodbye it was good good times oh owen is the limit the challenge is over and in case you're curious what brock did

this island i don't see anything on this island oh my unfortunately totally not a trap there was nothing on this island for you to kill but hey you get to keep the m249 i'll let you have that jingo how are you doing today i'm doing pretty good man how about you so look below you does this look familiar to you looks like a stone foundation so uh we're gonna play a game of tic-tac-toe would you

have 60 seconds to farm me any node starting now go go go you you have 60 seconds this is probably a bad place to choose you can go outside of this grid to find this node but you have to find some place in 50 seconds i don't see any nodes so far this is not looking good for you it's been 25 seconds you need to start going forward you need to find a node right now three two one oh unfortunately you guys are all the losers of today's videos so i'm giving you guys an opportunity to all win at the same time let's get required trust these players will be playing split or steal you have two decisions in this game either split the skins or steal them for yourself one by one each player will walk up and hand me a note with their decision if all players choose to split they all walk away with skins but if one single person puts steel that person walks away with the entire prize however if more than one person chooses the steal option no one gets anything these players have to trust each other so let's see what the contestants will do we all want skins right we overall losers we can all be winning one way so if one person puts steel they get everything but if more than one person puts steel no one gets anything yes this is simple this is simple everyone just put splits here's the thing either everyone gets nothing or everyone gets something yes and to my surprise the players were sticking together and trusting each other to split the skins i made me realize that there is some good still in this world but then things started to go horribly wrong how are you guys feeling i know that was stressful how you guys feeling the amount of people that wrote steel on their notes is four wow oh you guys all suck you guys all suck i can't believe this so in this arena i have everybody who competed today for challenges and the last person standing will win a skin pvp is on go go go last person standing go go go go go oh my god some oh my god people are dead oh my god someone can laser oh my god oh my god oh my god israel congratulations i'm sending you over skin right now you just won the battle royale all right wrong way up i'm back and you're still hitting

is equally split between everyone they give away twenty thousand dollars a week by just doing this i doing back their harvest i'm almost done bro i got this skin in the bag this is easy hold up not to mention clash also has different game modes such as upgrader and case battles and they also have a leaderboard where the top players on the site win free skins now if you want to get started you can use code fancy in the free cases tab and open a free three cases it also helps me give away more skins for my future videos let's go give it a go harvest i'm sending you over this ak skin right now let's get right back into the video i keep getting vodka what is this game trying to tell me great the game gave me bleach now workbench level three no i guess i have placed a landmine somewhere so uh

this island well on the map they spawn near the lighthouse and azer's base location is right next to it so he had to deal with zombies throughout this entire challenge azer if you're watching this i am so sorry full gold egg please bless me i got the same thing hey fancy what do you want to trade me for a tier 2 what would you like what's something that you need i'll give you a thousand gun powder for that tier two uh be careful there may be land mines and snapchats oh all right watching my step all right i'm coming to your base here i go oh my god i see one of your landmines all right i made it all right here's your gp because it's about to be disrespectful thank you very much pretty funny i am wasting all my ammo killings i feel like i hear a whole war going on over there bro that's because i live in the ghetto i'm in the ghetto whoa whoa whoa hey bunny bob oh this is property of fancy up here hey i see your foundation oh they're using your first suit yeah you frankenstein's dead that's how you like it now azer huh that's what you did to mine so i do it to you you disrespected me so much you killed my own frankenstein and then you went to my own table to make your own what did you think was gonna happen huh oh my goodness all right boys i need you to listen to something yes okay oh i got one oh yes wait oh i got a workbench level two i thought that was three people sad baby people oh my god oh oh my god what oh my god what no you don't say i don't say all right all right little guy look no we called you a little boy boy i just little boy i'm looking at debo camera and azer has so many bodies around his base you can tell he's just been fighting this whole time all right i need to upgrade my base a little so i'm gonna start upgrading right now so i do the same base design every random farming challenge but there's a very important detail to it there's always a garage door with an auto turret behind it and if someone raids my base later in this competition this auto turret will take them out and later in this video you are going to see this in action and see how amazing the idea actually is ah did it well honestly oh my air drop from earlier i forgot about it oh i got a chainsaw holy baby please no holy more i got actually more wow yes can you hear me yes master all right boys pvp has now been enabled and you guys can leave the team now oh it's real now

happening bang timer i'm just watching i saw him let's go at least finish the raid finish the raid you ain't finishing no way we can't it's sealed and armored really goddammits so uh what's the point now this challenge lasted a long time there was about 30 to 40 minutes of back and forth pvp but harvest was able to finish the raid on murray's base that i was blowing into earlier complaining about zombies and animals screwing he is dead marty's gone this challenge it was now down to a 1v1 between me and harvest but now i was the one being raided because okay i think you should be that much it's not looking good for me huh oh yeah oh so no no no no no no stop stop stop stop stop stop stop about one hp how would you not die oh who does it first at this point i'm confident oh oh wait you're ready me now come on come on oh my god don't do it mama don't do it please mama harvest is definitely rushing back here no not this window is definitely not one rocket away from all right please tell

you can open up tons of different reskins now look at how amazing these cases look they have different themes like summer or halloween cases and they have cases for certain items like ak or lr cases only i do invect their confusion i'm almost done doing terrible majority of these cases are expensive either so you can have fun testing out each one not to mention they also have case battles where you go up against other players and the upgrader game mode as well lastly you can use code fancy to open up a free case so open that bad boy up congratulations confusion i'm setting you over some skins right now let's get back right into the video for my next trap i'm going to build a tiny base with two doors one of these doors will be unlocked with an auto turret behind it if he opens that door he'll be killed and if he somehow goes through the roof he'll have an auditor there waiting for him all right according to my calculations you should not be able to get out of this without dying i really hope you don't big brain this but i don't know i might be missing something here but i think you should be able to die to this i think i'll be granted dude i'm nervous dude i don't know why

can splash damage this ow oh i broke something i broke something come on decide that i was telling you to come out on and that's trip yeah i reverse reindeer i reverse big reindeer let's go all right three to two now i gotta start from scratch confusion has three points and i have two but whoever gets the kill first on this last switch will score the point if i don't kill confusion first i'll lose this challenge the elevator one was kind of good i know right oh this gave me an idea for my last trap i was going to take a submarine deep underwater when the 10 second timer pops up i'm throwing the c4 on the submarine there will be only two outcomes to this confusion either drowns because he can't swim to the top fast enough or he'll enter the submarine to avoid drowning but he'll be blown up by the c4 never been in one of these before wait what one of these yeah what does that mean why are you out in the ocean yeah i'm just uh doing a little exploring you're making me nervous i don't have a scuba tank you're going under the water uh no like i said i'm just doing a little exploring down here oh my god wait if i can make the fishing village but i won't be able to hey it's it's beautiful down here you'll have a nice view oh oh oh it all depends on this come on yes oh no what's that no oh i instantly died no what happened no i instantly died too i died for no all right confusion so i have four points and you have four points i was able to get the last one because if you look in that chat uh you died first so that means that we tied that means we gotta do another rematch you're gonna go down buddy you're gonna go down oh yeah you're going down you're going down that's right i buddied you ,2021-10-31T15:31:36Z

agECuTbAuUM,Rust Odd Man Out 7 vs 1: Who is NOT a Rust Content Creator?,101465,2478,134,0 days 00:11:31,today i gathered eight rust content creators i am a rust content creator i am a rust content creator i'm a rust content creator i am a rust content creator i am a rust content creator i'm a rus content creator i am a rast content creator i am a rust content creator one of them is lying and is not a rust content creator if the group can discover who is not the rust content creator the all-spitter prize of rough skins but if the liar survives and is still in the box by the end of the game they'll win the entire prize i made all players change their steam and discord names so they can't cheat by searching their channels this is rust on man out okay all right mostly stream on twitch i have like 7.5 k followers and i have 250 subs right now okay also upload on youtube and tick tock okay you can already tell by my mic yeah you already know um i upload on youtube i have about 13 000 subscribers um make base building videos stuff like that i don't know youtube as well i mostly make rust music and cinematics i'm a small youtuber i have like 950 subs not that much but like i make rough skits and everything i do twitch tic tac and youtube and i just upload shorts and sometimes long videos up there i mean the round was kind of fast but i'm going for raptor because he just seemed kind of sauce i think the few people that i'm like 60 mainly because his voice sounds suspect right frog box um i think i'm gonna vote for frog box because he was late and i hate him i think i got voted off because i sound young man ah this is why we need communism back or something and not a democracy because democracies suck okay okay i have i had a question i thought of what uh what sponsors have you guys worked with if any or like if you're if you haven't yet what would you want to work with um i did one with howell so that's my answer i got offered by how but i haven't actually like done any sponsors yet i had a iceland hosting sponsor i was gonna do a sponsor for rusty light it's a new gambling site coming out but i don't know i'm pretty small so maybe one on the bigger youtube channel maybe i've had i've had bounty offers but i reached out to artesian builds recently but i'm not 18 so i can't get the thing but the advertisement guy got back with me and said like i was perfect for it but then i couldn't get the sponsorship oh yeah same thing i'm not eating so probably no i used to do me panda.com oh bandit okay yeah yeah it was better okay big question explain the youtube algorithm basically the higher your click-through rate and average view duration the more it'll recommend your videos i mainly just stream on twitch so i just upload like highlights and clips on youtube and make those sort of things in some storyline videos subscribers do you need to get advertised hours how many hours yep 4k 4000. shorts watch time doesn't affect it yeah short time true okay question for people that post on youtube what's the best thumbnail for a youtube short nothing like another game exactly that was a trick question literally just gameplay i make thumbnails on all of mine though still and i've and i've noticed that mine have done a lot better than some other people's they say in a little faq that they won't show the thumbnail but i don't know if that's true on on pc it does show but on mobile it doesn't what do you guys like edit on you guys use adobe premiere adobe photoshop switch to premiere pro as well i struggle with premiere i use filmora still but i'm trying to go i couldn't tell who was talking so i just went for grungus i think i'll be voting for 60 the whole round was about youtube and i'm mostly just a twitch streamer so 60 didn't really have any good answers like the other guys they all knew more like analytics i'm watching brock he didn't talk that much and he never asked any questions so yeah man it sucks i mean from what i heard they had more experience in russ content making than i do i don't think i was too good on the youtube statistics they were talking about if you believe the mole is still in the box and you'd like to continue playing please step forward now all right we're going into round three have you guys done any like creator events like participated in because i did trust and rest each student did a creator server like eight months ago that i was a part of or ten months ago no i was also part of that too yeah oh sweet i also was in dhp which is twinkle caves like kind of take on otv i used to play on uh rusty miss medium with some streamers and make content with them but nothing like official yeah i got a question what kind of servers do you got do you guys like play on official vanilla rusticated solo trio i stream on stevia so that i can get like constant pvp oh my gosh what is the longest it's you've ever spent editing a video for me it's like eight hours three weeks whoa oh my god i edit for people outside of streaming in like youtube so i've edited like seven hours to a day before i made some montages and just like stream highlights that only it takes like a few days once i get all the clips okay who's uh who's a rust content creator that inspired you like for me i started watching well and i was like i can make videos like that i was the first person i watched but i was confusion i used to watch and that's like what the what was that you're doing it you're wrong how many subscribers do you have 13 000 oh what do you post i make like base building videos um like kind of base building i make like different bunker bases um i just did like a two by two where you could put foundations in front of the door like half foundations and it's really hard to get in okay just watch men what do you post gorilla on youtube yeah sorts what kind of shorts um when i play i usually all the time record when i play and if i if something funny happens i'm gonna upload it on youtube how many subs thank you cranberry what do you do again i stream and then i post uh my funny moments to youtube and then i post them also to tik talk i have 7k on tick tock 1.2 k on youtube and 1.2k on twitch i used to post cs go videos but for now i don't i used to do fortnite montages nice okay so i think it's frogbox because his mic kept clipping and like if you're a content creator that's a huge no-no so i think it's him i i think either gorilla uh cranberry or pipsqueak just because i don't think they answered that many questions i don't know i don't believe gorilla he said something about like he has 10k subs over posting rush shorts i mean shorts are pretty good like it's kind of hard to believe i don't know like i didn't talk that much i only said i upload swords uh i do upload something else but like i don't know if you believe the mole is still in the box and you like to continue playing please step forward now alright that is majority we're going into round four so pipsqueak you said you had like 250 subs on twitch right yes how much money do you get from each twitch sub i get two dollars and fifty cents that is correct also do you guys know your streamer name when i stream i don't use remote because i play with my community yeah so i'll give them the server and stuff yeah so you guys like searching for content yeah like i get like loads of people deserving i think the most i've had is like 150. oh my gosh yeah damn it's nuts dude how do you not get like kicked off the server with 150 people oh i know i do honestly like we went on andy solomon once we all just got kicked and you could just see the whole chat like so many people getting banned at once okay i've got a question do you guys use your community tab like with your youtube yes i just unlocked it like a week ago and i've only posted three posts because i hit 1k a week ago i am so close for hitting it i found out that it's so cool dude you need 50 more i can get it if you post like a meme you'll get a ton of likes because like people don't read the text so just post memes and you'll like get interactions and it goes to other people's channels too um and also it only gives you like you can do a preview and it's a one by one square so if you like treat it like instagram like i don't think it makes people watch your videos but it makes them like think about your channel like that you know yeah you pop up in there right i've had like eight people sub from it and i've had like 45 interactions with the three people oh dude i gotta that's good i'm gonna be all over that when i get this thousand subs dude okay pipsqueak if you stream how many uh followers do you need to get affiliated a hundred um or fifty isn't it 50 yeah it's 15. honestly i knew it was a 50 or 100 but i couldn't remember because i got affiliated within like three days of me starting streaming so i never really kept up on those like small analytics so i really didn't know 15 an average view duration of three yeah yeah that's average about like crumb yeah i do i stream mainly my biggest videos are like the ones with reactions because of the face cam do you like put your face in the thumbnail uh i did for like a week but i noticed that whenever i just use like if i put like a gun in the thumbnail and i base it around rust the thumbnail around rust it gets way more interactions because people don't know my face but like if i have like 50k one day i'll use my face like i'll have a community around my face it doesn't matter what your face looks like just do the mr beast like mouth open whoa red arrow just a big red arrow in the big red circle exactly yeah circle like one guy on the roof that's like one pixel it's pipsqueak because she claims to have streamed and she claims to be like a 40 average year streamer she said she has 7k followers and 250 subs which is a crazy rate right there because i have 1.2 k followers and only 20 subs i'm also a dude you can cut that out and she says she doesn't know the uh the affiliate follow thing i feel like everybody knows that because that's the biggest first milestone you hit as a streamer it feels really good when you hit it i'm mainly thinking pipsqueak because she did she did get one question wrong i think it's because i misspoke and i didn't know to get affiliate on twitch was they had to pick something if you believe the mole is still in the box and you'd like to continue playing please step forward now all right we are going to end the game there if the fireworks turn green that means you have successfully voted out the mole and everyone in the box will win rough skins if the fireworks turn red that means the mole is still in the box and everyone else loses if the person who is not a rust content creator could step forward please do so now you guys got debated by a commentary i'm a face builder i was like that would be so easy oh he still knew what he was doing damn it so i'm actually jabroni i'm a commentary youtuber um you might have watched some of my videos about different content creators if people get cancelled or like crazy stuff happens i'll make a video about it so and i used to play a lot more rust so i think that's why i was able to trick everybody but i haven't played a wipe in a long time so i was very scared that they were going to suss me,2021-10-12T15:00:02Z
8TT-tEZ7jyo,This 1 Grid Rust Server Gives You RANDOM ITEMS When You FARM (Random Farming),110627,2399,129,0 days 00:10:55,this rough server gives you random items when you farm for example when i hit the stone node i get a workbench level one when i farm this tree it gives me a shotgun anything in this server that you try to farm will give you random items instead of resources and today i'm playing on my one grid random farming server so let's see how this goes alright the random farming series continues so today i am on my own server as you can see this is actually a one grid random farming video so this is gonna be hectic the server actually just wiped so uh i gotta get a base down and do good because i'm trying to make some plays so if i hit this tree i am getting random items you guys have probably seen all over my channel you guys know the deal you guys know what's happening i'm thinking i could build on the outside of the island oh i got a c4 we could actually raid someone wipe just happened recently so there might be like a little small shitty base we can pick on and as i say that there is a base right here so i know his tc's in the stone but we're just gonna say it we're already writing this is literally 10 minutes into this video and we are waiting oh no oh wait there's loot oh my god we scored big with this oh my god holy well i don't know what to do now i have a bunch of loot in here i don't have a base though i need another explosive all right let's see if we can get some explosives out of this oh oh my god i got a c4 from this i swear to god this is not scripted holy okay we're going to finish this raid we're going to get tc then we're going to take over this space it this is where we're going to build for this wipe dude i already got two c4 from farming oh shock and trap all right gotta be careful oh my god tc is already there and he has materials for me oh my god this guy was loaded oh my god bro now what you're about to watch is a very important lesson to learn and rust people always say to be nice in video games but this is the reason why you cannot be nice and rust oh no oh no oh is this your base bro nah bro oh what the no no no come on man this is not fair this is not fair this is not fair but you have to pick me up you were supposed to die oh no dude i actually fumbled the why did i not kill him this is no i have to go back i have to try to kill this guy dude i am oh you guys are going to flame me in the comments dude i'm i is my goal to get that base this this video will not end without me getting that base back i will have all the loot in there i will make it my goal for this video oh no he's still in there he's taking it over dude well there's only one thing to do in this situation and it's the door camp oh no dude he took over the base are you kidding me even cleared tc hello fancy orb i see you up yes yes i know but i'm gonna get my base back don't worry go demon or fancy don't let this guy dig you around like that oh i'm not gonna let him dick me around i'm gonna get this base back you kill him whenever you get the chance oh no something's coming up go away listen man listen no no no we can talk about this okay that was supposed to be mine and you took it from me don't don't you think we can come to an agreement first if you want to team up you know i'm i'm down maybe you add each other to a team a little base controlling okay okay let's go okay sweet i can't even get in there right now hold on okay should i do it you kill him whenever you get the chance i'm such an what am i doing dude oh my god what did i just do what did i just do oh no demon orb told me to do it man demon orb told me to do it i'm such an oh i'm kind of stuck in here though i didn't really think that through but i do have he grenade so oh please tell me that's gonna do damage okay that did that did we get out of here okay i'm sorry bro demon orb told me to do it i didn't do it demon orb did it bro it was demon orb it wasn't me it wasn't me oh my oh oh no how do you keep coming back with the python man we don't need that base although i had a bunch of luke i don't deserve after what i did you know give me that ninja suit oh my god dude this server is crazy they're calling me on a chat they think i'm a fake i literally killed two people on the beach and now they're already calling me out the spawn is just crazy look at all the random that people are placing bro card tables wall gates sofas a snowman what the is this dude what is this server bro why do people do this wait that gets smart i can farm these bodies to get something flamethrower that's all i need we're going for it i'm just going to burn the burning down you'll burn burn burn no there's so much action here where are these people coming from there's like 20 people here so i forgot that you can actually harvest bodies to also get random items it doesn't need to be a tree or it doesn't need to be a stone node it can literally be anything that's probably why people kill each other so much on the server because you literally have random items on your body oh gold egg hey back up bro back don't throw that rock at me back up let me harvest this body or else you're next yeah yeah you want to test me you want to test me you want to test me back up youtube buddy back the up back the up you too back up all of you back up get over here back up kid back up kid i'll be back up get out of here get out of here let me harvest this body in peace get out of here oh fire why are there so many people here why are there so many people yeah yes oh my god help me help no i died don't no don't get away from me i still i just don't like you get away from me no why are you crawling near me no no no no get away from me you're being you're being sussed bro oh well people have recognized me on the server now i guess it's too late oh jesus drop your stuff oh my god that's a paddle oh my god i'm sorry i'm sorry oh don't her okay stone spear all right here we go now we can actually do something hey get over here kid time for you to die well you're about to see him again oh god oh no dude there oh they're announcing it all right why they got it now oh i gotta tommy okay we got something oh please get up get up i need that ak okay we got an ak we got 15 bullets but i'm a beamer why is there a 16 times scope on this yes i got him oh unfortunate man that one yeah unfortunately oh the server is impossible man this server's impossible new adventure here we go got a yoka already oh let's let's try to yoke of this guy oh my god he just got blown up in front of me dude you blew that guy up i'm naked i'm naked no i'm not oh he's pissed he's gonna come back i gotta get the out of here oh oh i gotta get out i gotta go go go go go go okay let's go let's go let's go let's go we're making plays making plays oh my god dude there's too much right now oh no i decided to do a bunch of random farming to try to get a base down since you can't farm resources on the server you have to recycle the random items you get at the recycling i managed to get a tiny base down we got a base down let's go there's a new base over here oh there's a guy here oh oh oh my god oh no oh no he's already mad at me in the chat i got my jackhammer got three notes here let's see what kind of loot we can get oh my god look how fast it goes yo oh i got a c4 oh i got two rockets oh my god this is insane and i got an lr okay okay okay kid wow one note from a jack camera will get you all that dude we will come back to hit those nodes but dude we have raiding material i can actually raid someone oh wait oh wait someone just built a base here what the someone actually just built a base here right across from my base are you kidding me we're back in my base but we have a neighbor and he needs to go all right c4 here we go all right here we go c4 in his base let's do this all right you're in oh it doesn't have anything oh that's that's juicy though we'll take that all right that was much easier than i thought it'd be oh someone's outside my base oh thank you sir i will take your loot and it will be put to good use next i did a little base upgrading since it's extremely easy to get explosives on the server all right we have successfully expanded our base it's looking a little scuffy right now i have a stone ceiling high quality walls metal balls it's it's hey but you gotta do what you gotta do in the server i think it's time to raid that base that i try to take over at the beginning of this video i'm taking over the base that was once my home i honestly wouldn't be surprised if he did despawn it but but the loot does not matter in this situation it's about taking back what is ours oh no dude that was so loud i hope no one comes here oh okay there it is i see it wait baby we can just oh wait bryn no he did d-spot okay there's still some left there's still some left oh he did despawn everything but we have our home back which is good oh our base is our home now dude finally took over this base successfully this video will not end without me getting that base back,2021-10-05T14:30:04Z

Q1QUHG0IQPk,"Rust Random Farming For Random Items, The Movie - (Revenge Story)",759431,11558,328,0 days 00:31:55,today i'm playing on a rust server that gives you random items whenever you farm when i hit this tree it gives me a semi-auto pistol when i farm the stow node it gives me shotgun ammo anything in the server that you farm will give you randomized items from this game this is my own public server and adjust wipe so there's a full pop today i'm with my friend confusion and it's our goal to dominate this server but i have to go undercover today my name is buca because people will easily recognize my name if i put it fancy work today you're going to see how chaotic this server gets very quickly all right i'm in the teacher oh all right i'm literally just getting spot killed you spotted it in the same place it's terrible we're we're just in the hood right now yeah i know we gotta we gotta get out of the spawn man now our first goal was to get out of spawn aka the hood we call this the hood because the spawn is the slums of the server because it's filled with random place items and naked's killing each other because they can harvest your body for random items this is a dangerous area on the map hence why we call it the hood how about you see for yourself together then we gotta go to our spot oh we gotta have two four nine oh my god you killed the guy oh my god oh my god oh no oh wait armador yeah oh somebody says what was in here oh my god i killed him what the okay i killed a full medal uh oh my god that's actually looting here what the no shot oh oh i got scared he's obvious i'm i'm done i'm done oh my gosh you scared me so i jumped it's a lot like calmer out here because like yeah it is there's not as many bases at least we made it out of the hood that's um yeah we made it out of the hood baby baby yeah by the way if you've always wanted to play random farming like you see in this video i have three servers up random farming main random farming small and a random farming one grid server all servers are wiping on the day of this upload so go check them out by searching fancy orb under the modded section or the ips are in the description we quickly made it out of the hood and looked for a nice place to build we wanted to build somewhere near a recycler because that's how you get resources on the server you recycle the random items that you get however on our way to recycle items we saw a base in our desired area oh god there's body bags all around this base okay just just focus on the target get to the safe zone come on come on go go go but our focus right now is to get a base up so we went to outpost to recycle all the items that we got from the hood all right uh like uh the recycling starts now i don't have anything that recycles for wood though furnace uh do you have extra wood by any chance i just need it i just need a building plan hammer oh you're you're amazing brother you're an amazing brother good on you man brother back there take uh behind you take a grenade launcher brother yeah yeah behind these rocks you see this thing yep yep trees oh i got another m2 oh thompson from a crate yeah i got another one too oh my god what the hell i got an empty from hemp oh my god is that your third ensuite today yeah jesus man after a little random farming we recycled more items to quickly finish our base but you're about to see how quickly things can change on this server oh you got a building base oh oh my god you're insane dude that could be big what if he has resources oh my god look at it oh my god we're doing this we're doing this oh are we waiting here oh my god oh my god we're already waiting holy let's go let's go let's go sorry everybody back into the hood for you oh my god is he in there no way oh he didn't even have a baby oh my poor guy whenever you kill someone on this server you never know what they could have on their body a simple man who made it out of the hood was trying to get a base down and he just happened to have a c4 we used against him wow dude look how quickly things can change on the server but that guy was just building his base and the next second he just got raided what we just got loot just like that dude hell yeah let's go actually never good enough yeah dude we got a great oh do you have that furnace uh i do it is one of these boxes um wait confusion you don't have a skin for this furnace no i i don't well confusion if you can turn off all these furnaces by the time i'm done talking about today's sponsor i'll give you this furnace skin gonna go quick today's video is sponsored by rust clash clash is the first and best rust case opening site you'll find today in fact if you use code fancy you'll get three free cases go open those bad boys up along with having game modes like case openings case battles and upgrader they have something called rain where it's literally a pool of money they give away to all the users on the site every 30 minutes they give away 20 000 a week by just doing that they also have leaderboards where you can win skins for being top players on the site rustclash is a great opportunity to win free skins so make sure to use code fancy congrats confusion but we gotta go make more plays so let's get right back into the video after establishing a starter base it was time for confusion and i to go back to the hood and yes i know it sounds crazy but if you want action on the server it's the perfect place to go it's gonna be on alerts yep yep oh god oh my god okay the suspense oh he's chisel you got him you're gonna take the shot killed nice nice nice i'll cover i don't know i'm getting oh my god we can't go downhill we're going too deep don't go down that hill though i lose this way oh generator oh my god dude oh my god dude i prioritized what would you do what would be chills do okay i have incense i don't know uh you're going to have to um there's so many db nakeds out here god okay just hold just hold chill and jump okay we got it we got it we're secured we're secured we gotta go down dude we gotta go we can come back we can come back for too long let's go let's go let's go oh even though the hood is dangerous bro the hood is full of opportunities bro after getting a ton of guns and explosives from going deep we went back home and recycled a little bit more we also expanded our base a little bit because we had a ton of loo we needed to store we were on a snowball right now but do you guys remember that base we saw earlier the one in our area yeah they needed to go oh dude i'm fairly certain because i remember he cheated his backside first so oh my god we're actually doing this i don't hear him in there he might be farming loki oh dude oh what the hell what's up what is this should we just oh oh my god nice nice nice oh i'll cover outside oh you can you can steal now just steal nice i'll just make a tc there's a lot of in here he might be running back so no i haven't heard anything but yeah i'm watching that door like a hawk yeah he's out you have to hear something is that he has it he is uh he's coming inside let him open the nice let's go dude after another successful raid we recycled and added turrets to our base oh someone's pulling up oh he's dead nice hazmat he might have loot oh i'm head shot i'm head shot i'm out in the open right now oh yeah there's two people oh i think i killed their friend i'm kind of pinned down so i can't even peek dude yeah i can't even peek so i don't know how far they are it sounded pretty far if you if you're gonna do we're gonna do some murder right now you cause the distraction maybe i can peek back on this question right now hold on double one dead nice i'm doing nice dude oh my god what the hell all right this guy oh my god he had he had a bunch of good now there's another oh i see the guy down here oh my god yep l96 full kit dude yeah dude they had like weapons with attachments bro we plan to go back to the hood once again for a chance to walk out with a ton of loot but something unexpected happened i'm nervous again man i don't like the hood but i came out on top last time yep we did we are we were the hood victors come look at his body oh my god oh my god four rockets oh let's depot this dude no no no no no no no no no no we have we have boom no we just bring it to someone yeah okay okay all right this is content dude at our hands all right it's just a quick depot you know oh shut up the guy outside his base oh you want to raise this guy it let's talk with him first hey man are you friendly yeah all right man let's leave him he sounds he sounds pretty chill he does sound pretty nice oh my gosh oh my god what the hell where did you come from uh i have another one this guy is actually loaded this guy's he's in his base he's in the base or he came around maybe kill them on top oh my god dude this base is actually loaded bro okay all right i'm uh making crafting hammer plan so i can block it off it's inside and out bro holy all right wow it's crazy how things can just quickly change on the server yeah for real i mean hey man we had the boom and he was talking so i don't know oh wow yeah dude oh my oh insane after yet another successful raid we were hanging out in junkyard that's until we heard an explosion this guy's there's definitely right over there you want to just yeah let's check it out oh my oh wait instant rockets we probably sniped from here too yeah oh yeah oh it's green across from our base was a nice island that had two bases one of them was being raided right now we've never been to this island yet but action was awaiting us ah it oh my god oh my god this guy's loaded want your trees yeah is that 35 where'd you shoot that he's gonna come out watch out watch out watch out i just you just shoot it you just shoot out the wall i'm going to hold it okay so let's go oh my god this guy's loaded too the counter raid was a success and we took back all the good items we needed afterwards i upgraded our base while confusion was having a little fun on the other side of the island oh my god i see you raiding over there oh did we just no oh oh my god having a little uh friendly bout uh confusion you're ready to go wrong yeah i'm down this is it 320 ish yeah yeah here you're up there oh there's money over here got on baby let's go let's go oh he's a bieber he's a beaver yes sir oh come on he didn't have anything oh man kill the naked fancy tap into demon orb he's just an innocent player he didn't even have anything fancy this naked will try to build in your area if you don't do it now he will kill you later i mean you do have a point kill him fancy unleash your anger you've been holding back yes are you good uh yeah i'm ah sorry sorry um let's keep going let's keep going yeah sorry i've seen something at this point we were just unstoppable every base we raided had explosives so we just went to the next space we saw we lived in age 10 and any base that was near us we raided oh oh if you're just going for it oh oh okay see oh yeah wow that's a loaded tc look in the box behind it oh my god hold i grabbed it i grabbed it oh my gosh damn dude we've eliminated oh new base right in front of us uh oh should we just should we just do a quick ride on this yes yeah all right just like any other base that was new in our area we decided to raid this one but this is where we meet our first enemies all right sure oh okay we're just going for it nice oh he's in there he's in there he is oh my god he is oh he's upgrading he's panicking i'll watch the front door uh let me know when it's about to break a break do you see him in there oh oh he sealed himself in with armored i don't know we're good we got him get ready get ready he's but i can't even see him dude here just just piss me up real quick get him just oh my god he's healed oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait we have cc though ftc gotta get a hammer get a hammer uh i don't have a hammer i'm gonna get one okay i'm going to get a tc and a hammer oh my god dude two guys are bolting man those both you guys just ruined it now we're gonna head shot one you should be dead oh my okay i don't know how they're seeing me dude i i'm backing up i'm just dipping those guys are making me mad you know what you know what we do to those people we failed our first raid somehow these guys were hitting impossible shots in the dark and because of it the base owner sealed his base we completely wasted our explosives because of these guys oh i'm just left for the first time one of us died whoever these guys are were a problem we needed to get rid of at this point in the video it is our only goal to raid these guys since confusion died he got their names but he could only remember one i'm headshot god damn dude these guys did you get the name of the guy there's doughboy 23. okay so you see that base down at the shore over there they were shooting from there so i don't know if they came i heard two acres from there from this point out we were only focused on raiding doughboy and his unidentified teammate but we weren't gonna do this alone we needed someone else who was gonna be on our team we needed a chad rust player who could take us to the next level of chadness if we were gonna track these guys down we needed a little help yo what's up guys meat blazed many of you guys have probably seen his twitch streams before in fact you actually might have his ruskin from the latest set of twitch drops today blaze was gonna help confusion and i find these two players who ruined our raid and together we will wipe them off this server ladies and gentlemen this video has now turned into a revenge story it was like hiding behind this base i don't know yet like but like i said it could be they were just coming from outposts and they're sniping us yeah this doesn't yeah it's a solo nevermind there's a key lock this is not them our first objective was to go to every base in our area to see if we could find them we'll just have oh this one perhaps oh someone's in here hey man hi you cut lit you want to give us all your boobs oh you're gonna raid me go ahead what's your name man what's your name can you type one in jack one in this is vs michael although he's not the guy we're looking for he will be an important character later in this video so definitely remember his name here's your like papa thick that's the other name what that's the other name that's the dual sure yeah i'm pretty sure confusion just remembered the second player's name after he typed in chat doughboy and papa thicke were our enemies we added blaze to our team but after doing so we had some visitors all right uh did you get the upstairs one yeah i got all the turrets we're good okay sweet let's go oh i'm dead oh my god that might be the that might be the guy that might be the guy is it papa thick oh my god oh my god oh my god thank you inside i'll

dead no no he's not he's behind the pole if you don't understand what just happened let me break it down for you we just added blaze to the team so he decided to go outside our base and get the turrets but that's when he got sniped by papa thick then confusion and i went outside and killed him and his teammate now this is a good and a bad thing it's good because we killed him back and we got slight revenge but it's a bad thing because now they know where we live and we don't know where they live i apologize for shouting if we got a little hype dude that was a little revenge right there yeah a little taste all right should we just go explore over there then see if we can find them all right let's do this god damn dude spoiled chicken with that all right he's coming back who is that oh my god right here oh no yeah this is the yeah he's like a little or something he's angry at the world oh look maybe hey hey michael imagine scripting do do you know where papa thick lives do you know that guy yeah and imagine having the big team because they're too bad i don't this guy you want to rate him hey you want to get rated kid do you want to get raided you can't yeah yo you all oh because i'm pointing the truth because i'm saying truth yeah i don't like you saying that uh dude how did you how did you kind of hurt my feelings oh wait he opened that please dude we have this could

papa ski and adobe no it's not papa ski no it's do you know where doughboy lives by a chance no oh come on stop stop the cat bro come on you know who that guy is stop the cap how am i captain yo blaze the the stream that you did like the other night where you went deep on those kids dude that was insane you fragged all those guys that was nutty you didn't see this guy oh wait what what what's over here oh my god there's a guy hiding what happened there's a there's a guy at the gas station can you give me food please please please oh he's chill he's chill you got any more food please brother come on come on wait this is the guy we tried to read earlier let's let him be or maybe he knows where papa vic is hey man do you know oh yeah you know where papa vic is do you know that name on the server oh i just got on the server like 10 minutes ago here did someone try to radio earlier because i saw someone was trying to raid you i heard over here yeah some toxic you let us know if you see them we'll try to raid them wherever they live we're your neighbor we live like right down uh in k10 by that shop the k10 shop that's us all right oh thank you dude oh let me give you guys a breakdown of our area we lived in k10 over in k9 lived the friendly man we tried to raid earlier we're friends with him now and he doesn't even know we were the ones that tried to raid him earlier and over in k8 lived michael these were the only people that lived in our area but somewhere here lived papa thicke and doughboy throughout the next two hours we introduced blaze to the hood we roamed around the map and killed anyone in our sight i'm not going to waste your time with it because it adds nothing to our story because we still could not find papa thick and at this point we played for a while and we wanted to get one final raid before we went off it was looking like after all this time we might not get revenge i'm thinking i'm thinking you know we send it we full send it all right somewhere i'll say like let's let's do the let's do like a good raid here and i think i'm going to call it uh a day with this because i got enough footage from today if we if we don't get it it's okay you know it was a great day we still came out on top but if we do get it that'd be huge as well confusion leader lead the way tell us where you a good base where you think we could raise i need to you know ah you know opportunity opportunities that way my friends that's right we'll just oh scott's at this place too oh this might be them this might be them no way okay okay okay wait where are they uh he's behind the basement oh he sees this he sees this yeah they're upgrading all right ready set go hit him once yeah dude just enough damage perfect is this them isn't it i baited him with the rocket oh they're saying your name oh let's open this up kill them inside oh okay watch out i'm gonna itchy itchy watch out they come in watch the front somebody needs to watch the front yeah oh my god they've got oh my god okay craft door craft door holy we got them nice nice recyclers in here too they have two recyclers are you kidding me oh my god no way no way oh i get to get rid of these bags oh my god top left dude oh why do they have so much wood oh my god and dude oh my god look at all the wood dc was loaded dude as soon as we were about to go offline the one random base we decided to pull up on was papa thick we truly caught him lacking and accomplished the one goal we wanted to achieve let him watch you hey hey man do you remember when you were sniping us when we were trying to raid earlier you countered our raid earlier man you're you're messing with the business that was not your business oh don't try to leave oh well don't try it oh should we should we give the guy our base since we're not going to be playing it amen can you follow us papa thick come with us man now we realized that we were being a little toxic we despawned all of his loo and he was a little sad we were done playing on this server so instead we wanted to give him our base so it would go to use oh he sounded so defeated when he said that wait how did you find out yeah how did you find out about the survey like your friend tell you oh it's michael dude oh my god oh he's beating me i'm down i'm down please pick me up good damn michael but michael was still in the area and i don't appreciate what he just did to me come on around the front come around the front all the turrets are off so we will admit we were kind of a little to you guys you know uh i will admit we did despawn all of your stuff so um that you know it wasn't nice yeah yeah hey listen we're just going to give you our entire base uh because we are off for the vipe yeah so uh that that skin oh oh what the hell yeah so we're gonna give you the basement because uh we're going to say it's michael actually do you want to do you want to help us raise someone real quick do you want to help us ride vs michael all right let's we had it wrong this whole time we realized that papa thick wasn't the enemy this whole time in fact we were so focused on getting revenge on papa we couldn't see who the true enemy of the story was it was michael this whole time and after trying to give papa thick our base michael came back for the third time screw you michael let's go kill him catch michael where's michael i'm 38 hp i'm dead on timer i hate you michael i had shot him just five of you five of you five of you you know this kid needs to go uh i need to beat this kid and i mean like maturing is realizing that you can be friends with your enemies unless your name is michael me confusion blazed papa thick and the friendly man we tried to raid earlier went to michael's base to send this kid back to daycare he tried to ruin our emotional moment with papa thicke and he was about to regret it if i if i remember him correctly he has three armored doors so that would be around six c4s hey michael is this stone i'll tell you every smoke oh no it's high quality all right so it's just a two by two but let's go through doors get two check it see if there's anything in there oh there is there is oh he's in there man you don't want to do this oh is that a threat we could have been friends we could have been friends is he threatening us can you guys cover me because i'm going to check the the boxes all right oh this guy someone's just watching you guys yeah i know it's it's the friendly game can i get my bodybuilder all right oh my god okay don't don't just run knuckles no don't destroy michael's away ladies and gentlemen that concludes our story ,2021-09-23T16:27:40Z
qtU-N4MlaaQ,"Rust, But When I Farm I Get RANDOM ITEMS",412228,7620,229,0 days 00:13:05,today i'm playing russ but we coded it whenever you farm will give you random items for example i hit this tree and it gives me a ninja suit when i pick up these barriers it gives me a python revolver anything in this game you can farm will give you randomized items today i gather three of my friends and will be competing against each other here's how it works we have a one hour grace period to farm up as many random items as possible in that grace period we must build a base with the recyclers that we have after the one hour grace period we can raid in pvp in order to eliminate someone you must destroy their tc everything is random so we have to get really lucky to get good loot let's see how this goes three two one go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go get over here me good luck virus i got the best oh my god i got an armored door off of a corn let's go but wait someone's got an lr already are you kidding me yes what is this first thing i picked up that's the first thing you got that's unfair kind of vibing right now how are you vibing or either just don't worry about it well i i'm worried about it now because uh i want to find out why is that a threat is that a threat no it's not a threat you'll just find out everyone in here has been a random farming video before besides potatoes so potato are you are you feeling a little threatened right now no i'm feeling good potato how many hours of rust do you have uh 8.2 oh yes eight you have eight thousand yo oh i lost i do we might be in trouble we figured out potato had over 8 000 hours in rust i quickly realized he was going to be the biggest threat in this competition and i needed to eliminate him before he'd eliminate the rest of us or that or that oh rocket launcher let's go i have one as well whoop-dee-doo but i don't have a skin on mine though well today is your lucky day meat virus if you can blow through this base by the time i finish talking about today's sponsor i'll give you this rocket launcher skin today's video is sponsored by howl.gg they are currently the hottest rust gambling site now howell came out with a huge update where they've added a game mode called the wheel along with that you can now enter referral codes for the first time so you can use code fancy for a free 50 cents to play with no cost at all along with that you can open up free daily cases and potentially win up to a 700 dollar skin speed virus i'm almost done are you in yet i got this howell also has other game modes such as jackpot and coin flip and for a limited time you can get a 50 bonus when depositing through paypal google pay pay safe or credit card i'm in oh you're in congratulations may virus i am sending you over a skin right now on the screen the link to howl is in the top of my description make sure to use code fancy all right come on need something good here i'm feeling it i'm feeling it baby me oh my goodness baby hey boys i i want you to listen to something real quick just open your ears oh we love the sound of that baby hey me are you are you threatened by my m249 i don't think anybody cares i really don't care what your mom sounds like at this moment oh me come on oh my jesus my mom watches my videos good hey i'll see you later mom if you're watching this uh just don't listen he's a cranky old man oh boys oh you got an ak all right everybody can't use it you don't know me yo this is going to be a very toxic video i can already tell dude just wait till we get to the rating boys fancy fancy yes all i got to say is bro your aim is honestly just to his mind for how many hours my ak spray isn't the worst all right i'm just going to recycle my second thirty i'll trade you if you're interested in potato it's gone it's already gone things were quickly getting a little toxic instead of trading his second tier two workbench with me potato decided to recycle it a little throwback to a random farming episode too if you guys remember all right never mind i guess i'll just recycle this tier three oh okay no yeah okay let's do it now it's recycled now if you guys remember the last episode one of the players was named me virus well he's playing again in this episode and he absolutely hates it when people call him shmita virus so i got on my horse and i decided to mess with him hello schmidt virus virus how are you doing today what are you doing don't do it don't do it no stop stop stop okay i'm sorry i'm sorry no me virus you're a horse and you is wrong with the horse's face oh my god hey guys just say uh just a little heads up meat virus does not like it when you call him shmeet virus we really don't do this again i just thought i just thought i'd throw it out there you know just in case me virus explained to us that apparently in the last video a ton of you guys dm'd him on discord calling him the schmitt virus and he was not happy they all did i had people like can you be my step daddy i might get the away from me everyone if you joined fancy's discord you could get a sweet virus step daddy application yes if you go to my discord and dm schmitt virus you should be at the top you can request for him to be your stepdad what a way to it up me virus you got a lot of dms coming your way i'm sorry oh hey thanks duh you just gave me a pretty good gun i got a jack camera oh my god that's insane with 20 minutes into this competition i got extremely lucky and received a jackhammer i now have a massive advantage over the other guys because i can now farm five times as fast as they can and get items at a fast pace now oh life's easy now boys yeah it's easy when you're on this side with my rainbow oh i got another silver egg oh it's so just got a stupid bunny outfit you deserve that rabbit outfit you why why do i deserve that hop on this dick oh too bad if i didn't have my horse from earlier i wouldn't have to be walking this whole time i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry you weren't being such a you would have had your horse and it would have been an awful process hello fancy it's time to go demon or no it's not i don't know why you're here you need to go fancy orb you were at this game you'll be unstoppable i already said it's too soon i'm not doing it yet maybe if you were milking the random farming series somewhere jesus what's his problem you can never get rid of me fancy warm remember this got an interesting base there uh commando it's a nice little square got a lot of walls for me oh my did you ball often you ball out the entire thing are you serious interesting interesting you almost got me with that i'm not gonna lie now while watching this video you're probably curious and want to give random farming a try and now you can i opened a public rush server that's normal rust except all farming gives you random items the server is open right now on your screen you can find it by searching fancy orb under the modded servers this server has a ton of players on it so you're going to have an insane experience with time running out in the competition i did a little base upgrading throughout the last three episodes i've done the same base design where i have a front door and a back door i also have a garage door with an auto turret behind it in case raiders get into my base i can open it and it'll gun them down oh another large loot bag a grenade launcher i got my last shabang in this box all right boys pvp has been enabled you guys can leave the team raiding is now allowed oh my god am i already being raided oh my god what is this dude oh my god i'm actually being raided right now guys lily oh my god what the as soon as the competition started i was being raided and door camped at the same time this was not looking good oh my god what is going on big boom go your way get out of here oh my god why are you rocking all the way down there but before i could go over there potato already finished a quick raid on me virus and eliminated him from this competition yeah tco oh wait did you already destroy his tc yeah it was open yeah i literally had nothing i lost all my and soon after he started to raid commando let's listen oh okay oh i'm going that way oh it's not you no oh i was sneaking up on him and waiting for the perfect moment to attack i seized my moment and i pushed forward and so no what yes i know i fumbled the bag all right i was filled with rage and immediately went over to potatoes base to start raiding him we had to eliminate the biggest threat in this competition or else we were all doomed well you guys just go all balls deep on my base but everything else is quiet time how's my base going boom boom oh it is potato hurt his base being raided so i knew he was on the way so i did what any other chat in this game would do i put the 8x on the tommy look it's boy yes get him pig get him yes wait are you outside i lost all my boom but it wasn't over yet potato continued his raid on commando but i was coming back for revenge back from the dead i'm happy with where i'm at because oh my god potato i went to the foundation now i might not be the best at pvp but i have great game sense i knew potato was going to quickly respawn and come back if i finished the raid on camano's base so instead i push up to one of the rocks by potato's base and waited for him to pass me i mean he is a orb makes sense okay i'm not happy what happened i got stuck oh that was close all right potato has been eliminated the biggest threat in this competition has been eliminated now it's between me and commando open that up for me fancy let me out this out oh i couldn't even see you wasn't kidding oh now i had all the rockets and it was time to finish this once and for all but something was off i crafted more ammo and meds before i went over to raid commando but it seemed like he was impatient it seemed like he was waiting for a sneak attack just listen to him real quick oh yeah bob i thought you're coming fancy you coming or not bob i could tell he was waiting in a cheeky spot and my calculations were right yeah and all right boys that is the game all right boys it was fun but i am your winner today ,2021-09-15T17:21:28Z
HCpso41n_80,"Farming in Rust, But it Gives You RANDOM ITEMS!",769628,12276,213,0 days 00:12:55,when i hit the stow note it gives me a silencer when i hit this tree it gives me a bucket helmet you get

so anything that you farm on this server will give you random items in this game today i gathered three of my discord members and will be competing against each other using this plugin here's how it works we have a one hour grace period where we can peacefully farm and build up a base each team starts with a one by one with a recycler so we can recycle our items to get resources we're on a very small island so we know where everyone lives after the hour grace period we can rate each other once your tc is destroyed you're eliminated from this game last person standing wins all the items we get will be random so we'll have to rely on rng to help us in this competition three two one oh a road sign jacket i'll take that but i got an egg and a torpedo yeah guys just saying i'm owen two in random farming videos so i'm really looking for the dub here so if you guys don't mind go a little easy this time just a little easier you know in the last few random farming videos there were a ton

base i can tell i see one little middle part just slightly higher than the others i know this is random but you know what i have my biggest pet peeve people who backwash into their drink oh that is disgusting floating look at all the just looking at all the floating particles you can look at like the bottle and you just see pieces of whatever they're eating with their drink and it's just dude it

other and i think i may have found a right target let's keep it to a minimum here we don't have to start anything right now come on man i mean just saying i i got a really good item in my inventory right here and it's got your name on it and it goes through your head oh i think it might be a gun oh that's beautiful we'd love to see that that's what i said i did hey guys uh listen to this real quick oh man no my ak sprays pretty good uh we go demon mode sometimes it's like uncomfortable oh workbench level two baby let's go that is the biggest flex of this competition so far we're all getting explosives and stuff but uh the tier twos and tier threes are more important now workbenches are crucial in this game mode since we have all the bps unlocked we can only craft explosives if we have a workbench we have to get extremely lucky from the random farming because it's nearly impossible to save up scrap to craft them with a few minutes left before pvp and raiding is turned on i finish upgrading my base and put some traps in it in case anyone breaks into my base to have an auto turret behind a garage door i can open and kill the raider oh okay i'll take 18 rockets oh whoa that works what did you just say i mean i mean two rockets i mean uh incendiary rockets hey i'm just saying that is like uh a very good first raid target for getting all the rockets the raid the rest i mean i mean no torque uh no i probably shouldn't have announced that dude because that sounds nice to me i don't have i don't know what a rocket is sweating right now me because i'm on the bottom come on now all right boys pvp is now enabled you guys can leave the team oh oh shit's real now that dude the vibe just completely changed i'm scared now pvp and raiding is now allowed oh shot that reaches that's blowing up in the air a lot of the almighty oh no you're gonna hit my horse how many hp's is it oh no hey fancy pal buddy hey pal buddy fancy did you steal my horse i did oh that's the car that's too far who's pulling up on the horse oh no i'm getting raided someone come counter oh no lava a gate oh me decorate guys guys i've been nothing but good to you remember the last like hour we spent together dude my horse is looking nice i'm low-key myself like is streaming out of my mouth what the hell up you dude god damn it that's the door mechanic god damn it uh at this point just work with what you got oh what the who's who is that is that is that papa oh my god i can't come outside or else he's from the shadows i won't lie no i'll lie i'll lie it's all right bro no one saw that right no one saw that right no we didn't see it dead yes he is i decided to go after papa ski next because i knew he had a bunch of rockets from earlier oh okay i'll take 18 rockets what though is someone blowing my base blowing you off bro what the how are you not dead you son of a don't do it to me okay i'll make a deal with you i'll make a deal with you i'll give you this supply drop right now you just you just hold it back a little bit i know you're coming up on me now although i got killed by azky he finished the raid and eliminated papa ski the deal is done you did it yeah let's go no it's a papa is eliminated son of a i can just swim in my pool before he boots me for the server you're banned i got jump scared oh there's a lot of loot in there dude there's like four m2s in the bases this is will's baseball are you kidding me bro come on oh yeah thanks it's such a it's a great base when i whip a whole hundred mag oh you won it what's up baby i love you i'm sorry i have to do this to you oh what the is that oh oh no you know what's happening next ask you see but you might as well prepare why are you trying to do over here because you know what's going to happen next take my tc go oh no this is not good well is eliminated oh no ah damn you didn't have in here what have you been doing this whole time no what the oh wait what how did that kill me oh i thought i got a hit marker oh they go through my door oh me no no no oh you're done now bro i don't think i am everything burns okay so there is no tc in here now ascii didn't have a tc next to recycler which caught me by surprise but there's only one other place it could be up the shaft it's just it's up the shaft oh oh it's up there that should do it all right gg boys,2021-09-01T17:43:27Z
G07atTimE-o,"Rust, But Farming Gives You RANDOM ITEMS 3 (ON A 1 GRID MAP)",261418,5418,167,0 days 00:10:43,today i'm playing russ but farming will give you random items when i go up to this tree and hit it it gives me a workbench level too when i pick up this hemp seed i get a nail gun anything i farm will give me random items that are in this game today we're on a one grid map and divided into two teams team fancy and team porgy each team starts with a 2x2 with a tc and some recyclers we have one hour to farm up whatever we can with random items and after the one hour grace period we could rate each other the first team to destroy the opponents tc wins we have to rely on luck to get really good random items so let's see how this goes all right three two one go go go go go go going down to uncle touchy town all right boys all right let's go let's get this let's get this what i realized is that we we're going to need to recycle a lot to get a base up so if you guys get like a high stonewall that's really good if you guys get you know wood walls anything that like would give you metal you know use that because we're going to need that dude i need some weapons to get oh okay i got five five ammo oh silver three yes you gotta work level three that's huge hell yeah that is huge five minutes into this challenge my teammate owen managed to get a workbench level three which is insanely lucky since everyone has blueprints unlocked the only way we can craft explosives is using a workbench level three that's exactly that's literally like one of the most i guess now we can craft anything dude yo no way you got an ak you got naked let's go i just don't have any skins for it though oh and you don't have a skin for your ak well today i'm going to help you out with that owen if you can land on the green before i finish talking about today's sponsor i'll give you this ak skin today's video is sponsored by russ clash now clash isn't your average rust gambling site they have many game modes like case openings case battles and everyone's favorite upgrader wow that's actually pretty cool i know right clash also has daily and weekly leaderboards where they give out prizes to those who wager the most and if you weren't able to compete on the leaderboards do not worry because they still do hourly giveaways i'm almost done owen how are you doing back there oh no yeah i hope i get it lastly clash has many different depositing methods for you to start playing and if you use code fancy you get three free cases go open those bad boys up yes yes congratulations

fold i'll call what does that do yeah they're not even trying they're just playing cards now throughout this video you're probably wondering how you can play this random farming mode well soon you can soon i'll be releasing my own random farming server for my discord members so if you want to play join my discord because that's where i'm going to post the ip yo i've got a speaker i'm going to go horizon oh lr okay i gotta think big on this why are they shooting already no bear smack my ass did you like it though like shut up christmas i'm gonna start building up a base guys do you guys care if i build it or do you guys have a you got that you got it you got it sir supportive team let's go all right i'm gonna go take a look at what they're doing people them up i'll them up dude i bet they studied this they got it or we're just like let's bring some cards he's supposed to win take that mp5 why take the ak when you can take this rock hey shut up you're in team you're in territory of team fancy get out of there oh yeah well you're in territory your ontario tour time to test out this chainsaw see how fast i get items oh my oh my god i got an l96 whoa let's go eleven i gotta be wrong wow that's crazy fancy let's see oh my god we were making fast progress on our base for team fancy but team porgy had a slightly different strategy i actually have a big brain idea if we if we make our base and draw a bunch of penises on it fancy will never be able to look at it because he'll get demonetized content restricted yes all right let's oh i got a rocket launcher thank you i got 11 rockets nice what kind though regular rockets no oh we can raid dude i have 11 rockets and a rocket launcher in my inventory the hell i got an l96 rifle that's good i got one of those i got c4 i don't know about you but i'm feeling real confident boys uh owen are you still doing like a roof camping tower out of wood uh yeah i'm i'm covering wood now yes you heard that right we were going to make a roof camping tower out of wood some of you might despise us a little but hey team porgy did the unthinkable they kidnapped our teammate carbon shots and traps him into their base carbon come come we're going here i'll take photo of you in the casting couch yes give me camera casting couch i take photo of you in the casting couch yummy yummy the casting couch yay what the say cheese with five minutes left in the grace period we rigged our base with traps and it was about time to enable pvp and ratings yeah we have ammo uh outside as well turn it outside as well pvp and raiding is now allowed pvp and raiding is enabled i'm scared i'm scared too what the are we going towards them are we letting them come to us okay i see someone uh they're like straight east i'm dropping their weapons to the wall i'm being raided there's rockets just rockets at our base everyone back to base yeah they're we're being raided guys we're being raided we gotta go back oh i think the turret shooting all right

when i'm keep shooting getting getting getting all right are we doing good boys holy i think we're going to win right now keep going keep going keep going all right i put i put some fireworks going boys we got to keep going so that tc is destroyed oh my goodness i'm down i'm down i'm dead man he's in the compound how are you guys going to get back to the mouth i'm pushing up with the rocket with the rocket launchers would you say they don't have access to the inside of their base or basically rocketed yeah all right i killed one killed one all right they shot another one they're shooting a couple incidents at our base i see him i'm gonna pp rocket too i killed one i think yeah yeah they're taking out my body with rockets i killed him kill him wait how is he alive what the yes the one random rocket launcher i happened to grab of course had an incen rocket you're lucky this time monty for the next 30 minutes it was just back and forth pvp but team porgy had all the rockets from our attack so is their turn to start raiding killing pig pig nice in there how i got hit by something all right someone someone just came in or is went to the right side doors doors doors oh sorry sorry for my straight inside the door hold on watch this jesus christ six oh yeah this is it boys i killed one in rpgs yep they got to see now yep that's that's game that's getting dc is exposed they're gonna do it let me go let me go one day took the w on this one after the match we went back to see how much we destroyed their base and you can see how close team fancy was to winning 169 hp and we would have had tc right there that is how did you guys die,2021-08-25T18:52:26Z

go up to this tree and i hit it it gives me a metal chest plate when i pick up this mushroom i get a chain link fence literally any type of farming gives random items but we are in a one grid map i gather three of my discord members and together we are fighting against each other with random farming here's how it goes each person starts with a one by one with a recycler and we have one hour to farm up whatever we can get and after the one hour grace period we can raid each other the last man standing wins so you have to eliminate them by destroying their tc this is where i am confusion is here mason is here and murty is building right here everything is randomized which will be the hard part but let's see how this goes three two one go go go go go oh my god wait oh i forgot okay i might actually have to end up taking it you guys are done you guys are done now you might be wondering how we are going to build a base if we can't farm resources but that's what the recyclers are for we quickly realized we would have to recycle a lot to get materials to build a base high external swood wool i'll take that but you're farming over there let's go would you would you get over there huh i don't know man you'll see this dude i've got a jackhammer oh my god that's gonna be all right yeah it's like wait yeah i just realized now murty found a jackhammer which is extremely op just for a reference this is how fast you would get random items when using a jackhammer oh wait that's the third time wait is there anyone called the airdrop in yes oh it's yours you got that's what you get yeah what confusion didn't know is that airdrops are also randomized and he was about to get the worst airdrop of his life what is like what are these items dude i've never seen them in my life duct tape when did that get what was that in the game oh i just got a c4 actually i got a c4 yes what no dude oh my i just got an ak oh what this dude is ooh silver egg oh this has potential oh let's go dude i needed that trumpet oh finally i got something let's go we got a rocket launcher baby oh my god i got a sin okay sure that's gonna be helpful can you stop taunting me with that aka yeah dude you're the only one there okay oh my god i'm gonna get mulled by another oh i gotta oh my goodness all right this is gonna help me oh this this might be bad for you guys so i found an l96 in low-key i was planning on roof camping after the grace period i just need to find a scope and i should have an upper hand in this competition we're playing right now all right the uh way to go with upgrading inventory school i just figured out an op strategy oh so basically chainsaws are op because you can you could harvest edibles since it's like worst harvesting power or whatever on the chainsaw like it goes slower like it goes the same speed as a jackhammer so like you can get like two inventories full of random items oh why am i wasting my time oh my god i just got an m2 oh my god oh dude why is confusion getting everything dude like do we need to take him out boys so if i want to place a landmine somewhere in the map or someone walked over is that their fault oh no you can place them oh god all right look out for the landmines boys soft beer oh finally let's go oh you guys are done now oh man thank you guys you guys are in trouble now all right we'll just uh let me remind you oh i'm actually kind of getting nervous that mason's like building up some compound over here dude he's got something going that's for sure all right let's let's start let's let's start i guess start what their murder what are you what are you starting over there huh after being in a call for so long with these guys it started getting a little toxic and murty was talking some smack this fancy guy you know he thinks he thinks he's all like top up he thinks he's up there you know it just really annoys me it gets on my nerves oh i gotta i gotta oh my god that's huge metal face mask baby can i just get you to listen to something real quick oh my god welcome to the club brother all right i'm actually getting a base up i didn't think i'd get this far i didn't think you'd get that far either buddy i need a tier three if i'm going to rage you guys i need a t3 too maybe baby yeah it was time for me to do a little base upgrading because we only had 30 minutes left of the grace period i also put an odd turret in my base to help defend it oh what'd you get i i just i i just got a level three oh what did you have a do you have a level three yet no so basically one with level three as the clock was running at a time the four of us realized we quickly needed a level three workbench if we wanted to craft boom the only way we could get a level three workbench was by getting lucky by farming or saving up scrap which would take forever this is a crucial item in the challenge i don't really care about that i don't know we'll see i was thinking that maybe i'll just you know just murk mason you know okay dude you want to see it hello supply signal yes actually i don't know why i'm getting excited this is going to be garbo oh no honestly yes oh gold egg all right come on please give me something oh let's go dude we got some rockets to recycle p for some uh metal frags i'll treat you with cake oh my god i've got a bolty i got a bullet you got a level three no dude everyone's gonna be level three oh i don't i don't i this bear almost just told me oh expo wait oh i'm stupid oh it's c4 let's go let's go let's think i'll be able to go i don't think i'll have a tier 3 and 20 but um i do have other i am going to give you the rest of hey i'll give you the rest of my scraps oh you yes i didn't die i didn't die i didn't die but god damn it so if i to play some lane mine somewhere in the map if someone walked over is that their fault oh how do i get that oh let's go workbench level three baby let's go baby no yes sir we needed that one you got resources um um not for you oh all right never mind i guess i'll just recycle this tier three oh wait you have another one yeah i got another one oh okay i know okay okay they're still like no it's recycled you just recycled it oh yeah oh you up that's what you get for being uh i didn't realize i didn't realize that you had another one i was like yeah you can now yeah that's really toxic dude oh no no no you don't understand like i was just trying to have a bit of a joke i was like oh yeah i don't have resources for you and he just took it too far the t3 workbench was like the one thing i needed in order to raid him okay all right so we on yep pvp and raiding is allowed but you can still farm you guys can still farm pvp and raiding is now allowed confusion instantly went to mason's base to start his attack oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god he's actually being crazy bruh oh this is insane oh wow yeah all right well that was fun i didn't even close my garage doors so you're done yeah confusion instantly raided mason and eliminated him from this competition it was now down to me confusion and murty i was thinking that maybe i'll just you know murk mason i'm not even ready i'm sorry you know i had to go on the offensive line oh okay i'm gonna take me into no clip it you know what peek again oh oh can't handle the jiggles the spacers got hit facebook guy homeless all right y'all calm down that's me are you okay oh i dinged him oh that was an instant no dude you're confused you're too good bro do that ak split believe it oh you're loading hvs you shooting hps oh what the hell you're already in oh my gosh i'm eliminated dude so i am eliminated you got all my loot in here congrats you got mason who's also rated mason man is done over here all right so murty it's down to you in confusion didn't really go anywhere oh no dude i can't see it there's a high wall wait i'm dumb bro i can just kill myself i got bags everywhere all right confusion you win close up blows up oh my

(Jubilee)",46897,1537,135,0 days 00:09:48,today i gathered seven players who have over 1 000 hours in rust i have over 1 000 hours in russ i have over 1 000 hours in russ i have over 1 000 hours in ross i have over 1 000 hours in russ i have over 1 000 hours of rest i have over 1 000 hours in rest over one thousand hours in roast one of them is lying it has less than one thousand hours if the group can discover who has less than a thousand hours they all split a price of rough skins but if the mole is still in the box by the end of the episode he will win all the skins this is rust on man out for this episode there is more than one mole in the box and the moles do not know each other all right uh well when when did everyone get the game right like i said early november 2017. was it 2018. nice early 2019. i bought it back in 2014 but didn't play it until like 2017 2018. that's reasonable yeah i remember when i first started i would always be into savage because that was just the you know i don't know kids on the beach what type of servers do you guys play on uh i like 2x also uh servers with group limits because otherwise i just get deserved i also don't have much time so i play on two x's now yeah exactly yeah yeah because i i feel like vanilla farming takes too long yeah i started vanilla and then i found the way of 2x and just been there since yeah i just don't have enough time i think ski is the my number one pick as of right now though it just hasn't really convinced me enough so i think i'm gonna vote for maple i don't really have any particular reason just you know it's too early to tell so i'm just kind of writing a random name uh so we actually have a tie right now so the tie is between brock and walter you each are going to have 30 seconds to explain and prove yourselves why you guys uh have over 1 000 hours in rust so like i said i started in july 2019 um i remember scrap update remember when the horses came out around august september been playing on vanilla's found the 2x 2x is great i don't really know how to prove myself in round one but uh yeah it's brock all right well i started around mid-2018 i played before scrappy's removed from the road and before horses are even a entity in the game and uh it's walter i honestly have no idea i'll say legit actually started in 2018 i didn't really give any signs to show that it was a new like didn't have below a thousand hours so i'm a little confused on that one uh we can go one by one in a circle if we have the time you know yeah yeah and we can go over like you know what servers we play our play style what we do yeah stuff like that you know whoever feels like starting first you can go ahead and go clockwise so like i said last round i play on a lot of boosted servers mainly because uh i don't have a lot of time with work and stuff typically i usually play with at least a friend or two but every now and then i'll solo and i i mainly i i stick to doing pvp and monuments you know i i mess around with some bass building but not not too heavily i kind of keep it basic because i don't like getting rated a lot like he said i like sticking to multiplied servers usually 2x or 1.5 uh i'll play servers you know like fresh vikings or garnet gaming but i do mainly stick to group limited servers because otherwise i'll just be overrun whenever i start on a server i like to get a crossing head straight to small oil like i know many players wouldn't do that but it's a hard challenge but it's definitely worth it all right so i typically play on like 2x3x rust vikings is always good it's a classic i only play with uh duo and trio though because you gotta be with the boys i mean i'm always the and everyone else is the baseboarder i'm not really a baseboarder myself but i'm the guy they always call when we're getting raided and i just go out naked with an ak and straight up kill every siege base one man style so you're the goat yeah boy nice so i'm basically the same as watermelon except not a pvp chad but uh yeah i stick to duo's trios i only played with two other people usually 2x at this point i did start on vanilla and then i played like two wipes on happis and i was like i hate my life i normally play solo uh but i do play with some friends time to time i try to play like 3x when i'm solo or 2x uh i tried playing like vanilla like you get ran over by xerx so it's it's crappy that's a solo i usually play on two times solo joey trio if i'm playing with like a duo or i play with just six random people when we're just like zerg rusty moose or something can just and just mess around with people tc everywhere just you know toxic stuff and just chat loads of you know nasty things to people but yeah that's maybe what i do that was the new update you guys oh i i love it dude you can see it look at this i got the i got the moves bro i got the move like people can just crawl away from the weapons and you won't find it ever again exactly no dude dude what i do with the boombox i play my own music in the tape recorder and then play through the boombox but it's only like 30 seconds so i didn't even think of that i'm gonna vote for water because his answer i just don't believe in this 2019 thing there's no way he's played more than a thousand hours within that amount of time because he also said he was very busy and i don't believe it gotta be watermelon he just he seems like he's a little skittish on his answers the way that he just comes across is kind of off-putting i think they had it out for me since the beginning you know i'm just wearing a wetsuit and a new twitch drop so i think they think the lack of skins means lack of hours who knows if you believe the mole or moles are still in the box and you'd like to continue playing please step forward now all right we're going into round three all right all right i got questions this is it's it's a pretty basic one but don't say the answer just say yes or no if you know how okay okay all right how do you what's the do you know the fastest way to loot like a loot a storage chest yes yes no who said wait she said i know yeah me call me so i think i up a bit for myself uh because i didn't know how to do the fast loading because i've never searched it up whoever said yes someone told me how a hover loop okay yeah good i actually have my hover loot set to my side mouse button yeah mine's mine's my left mouse because you could just hover over it and click it exactly do you guys do like combat training and stuff like that yeah i know i did a little bit but not much nice i don't do much really i like doing the the gun game and you know and small games is fun yeah dude it's good i always get stuck on review at the start because i'm just i'm that guy yeah as well it's terrible oh dude p2 is like the worst gun in the game i literally prefer revi over p2 because the recoil what uh like rush tubers do you guys watch i used to watch aqua but now i'm just kind of into blueprint for us i watch i used to watch so much vertigo and now i watch like stimpy more and so one of yeah blueprint also got a question about the horses how many horses are like less good white horses are better right yeah i think the white horses are the best ones not to be racist or anything but yeah no no no worries uh i think i think i'm gonna vote for nadi just because i feel like a lot of the videos he was referencing were kind of old and dated other than that there's not much to go on so i'll be voting for maple because he was kind of silent i feel like well as i said in the interview from last round i didn't know the whole thing thing i've seen on many videos but i i didn't like set it in if you believe the mole or moles are still in the box and you'd like to continue playing please step forward now all right we're going to end the game there if the fireworks turn green that means you've successfully voted out the moles and everyone in the box will win rus skins the fireworks turn red that means one of the moles are still in the box and everyone else loses oh god i forgot what the colors do um i forgot what red if the means could reveal themselves please step forward now yeah wait wait yeah what wait what what so many balls wait what oh my god oh my god you are i'm looking for new odd man out contestants there's a sign up form in my discord if you are interested,2021-08-05T17:07:42Z
3__y1a8a2UA,"Rust, But NPC's Are Random Sizes",39009,1020,61,0 days 00:07:22,today i'm playing rust but all animals are huge this plug-in randomizes the size of animals on this map so that means a bear could be five times its size or it could be 20 times its size the bigger their size the more health they're going to have and today i'm going to see if i can take down one of these creatures all animals are buffed including deer boars wolves bears and yes chickens and later i call and back up and have my discord members see if they can take one down too now let's go check out these animals well today i'm playing rust but all animals oh my god i was just doing the intro for this video i i swear i did not spawn that in this is not rigged as you can tell from this video all animals are huge you can see a chicken in the background and he's pretty huge you see that massive bear yeah so today all animals are massive some could be two times as big some could be 20 times big it's all randomized see oh my god so as you can see that bears about two or three times its size but that bear in the back is like 20 times its size so some animals are massive some animals are just slightly big but yeah we're going to try to kill one of these things today because these things are dinosaurs these things have a bunch of health they're pretty much tanks and i'm going to see if i can try to take one of these things down first i kind of want to go up to one of these things and see like what what is it like will it go after me holy crap oh oh my god that is terrifying that is terrifying get me out of here holy crap oh my god dude look at the pig look at the pig dude that bear is so massive dude and i actually can change the height of these animals right now the maximum size he can get is at 20 times i'm actually gonna change it later in this video and see what a hundred times bear will look like so stay tuned for that i might actually have to bring in a couple of my discord members to try to help me take one down because i cannot do that alone right now i'm going to try to get a bow though and see what kind of damage i can do to these creatures oh my god i can see him just a massive pig coming my way as i'm farming this tree this is crazy i feel like this could be added to like a server like this would be such a cool like feature in a modded server just have these big ass animals running around you get extra low grade and stuff from them so right now i'm just looking for cloth and trying to make a bow and seeing what kind of damage i can do see if i can kill any of these animals today oh my geez i think that that is the biggest bear we have seen yet dude that thing is mad oh it's fighting something is it funny something or is it just coming after me i think it sees me and i should actually start running here all right so i found a pig that's not too massive uh let's see if i can try to take this guy down oh he's just gonna run away okay of course of course i'm going to try this guy down because he's not small he's not going to go anywhere like where i'm not going to see him oh my gosh are you serious i have to run all the way down there to get him oh i got him come on come on yes yes yes i know why i'm getting excited these are massive hit boxes oh my god yep this thing's me up i don't know if i can do this it has like 600 health look 598 health this if i can get close to it 598 health i don't think i can take this thing out with a bow but as you can see all animals on the server are massive obviously that bear would not be that size and like mentioned earlier all animals are randomized so one could be at two times its size but one could be 20 times its size as you can see here this wolf is probably about 20 times its normal size but this bear here is about i'd say five times its size maybe four times it's not too big and as always this is my own plugin this is not a public server that you can just play on if you're a server owner or someone who just wants to play this mod and use it on your own server you can do so by getting it at my patreon page all the wacky plugins that you see on this video are available on my patreon and it's a way of supporting my channel but now i'm going to restart the server and see what a 100 times animal will look like maybe it'll be bigger than this dome we are about to see all right so we are now back after the server restart and we are going to see possibly what a hundred times animal will look like right now i'm gonna wander around the server and see if i can come across one but if not i can just fly around jesus the server can't even handle dude it looks like it's on some kind of drug right now oh my god right now i'm gonna fly around and see oh my god dude look at these things they're so messed up right now but you can just see how big they are oh my god look at the deer just vibing over here dude these things just take up the whole server oh jesus dude these are bigger than like clan bases bro so we've seen from this plug-in that the bigger that the animals are the more health they're gonna have so right now i kind of want to take down one of these massive monsters because clearly i couldn't do it earlier with just one bow so i'm about to bring in a couple of my discord members and together we're going to try to take down one of these creatures all right so boys do you guys have any idea what we are going to do today no no no guys i have no idea well guess what something is happening on the server that you guys don't know and you guys are about to see all right so go ahead and face the wall behind you guys and uh we're about to break the walls you know earlier today i was trying to kill one of these things with a bow it was pretty much impossible so i kind of need to call some backup so that's pretty much what you guys are here for today i'm gonna spawn you guys some guns i want to kill one of these things because i wasn't able to do it earlier by myself well actually let's kill this bear behind you guys we have to kill one of these big boys there's dinosaur hunting get a boy get it get it get it get it get it get it get it shoot it down boys oh it's so fast oh we got the chase that we have to chase him down oh wait dude he's in the water yo yo way he can swim the bears can swim in the water now it was hard to take down these giants with just bullets so we decided it was time to bring in the air force with rockets oh my god i can see him chasing you get out of there get out of there get out of there don't worry i got an escape plan right here i missed my rocket oh nice crouch squad's dead oh i missed but hell are you sure oh we do a little dying,2021-07-28T17:25:59Z

(Jubilee)",333866,8273,426,0 days 00:11:44,today i brought together seven players who have over seven thousand hours in rust i have over seven thousand dollars in rust i have over seven thousand hours in rust i have over seven thousand hours in russ i have over seven thousand hours in rough i have over seven thousand hours in rest i have over seven thousand hours in rust i have over seven thousand hours in rest one of them is lying and only has two thousand hours if the group can discover who doesn't have seven thousand hours they'll all split a prize of raw skins but if the mole is still in the box by the end of the game he will win all the skins this is rust odd man out okay okay let's go what's up what are you talking about wait what what servers i also play officials because i'm not a uh are we allowed to swear i'm not a all right no poju aren't you wellands though yeah fair enough that is fair enough but i'm a feisty let me clarify something though i think we can rule prince vids as safe you know he's been playing this game for what like six years or something like he's an og how long have you guys been playing the game for 2017 and september 27 16. i agree with porgy though i only play officials as well yes same same only officials i play with a big clan uh vital main man well if i'm honest i have a no idea guess i would say maybe porgy because he acts like a little child so i think uh i would think porgy has the less hours it was a really quick ground so i'm not super sure but i'm gonna vote for yikes just a gut feeling personally i voted for yikes i didn't really hear much from him i just i feel like i was too quiet i didn't have a chance to really say anything so you know they gotta pick someone so they picked me i can ask one thing how did the how did the simple sight used to look i think it looked the same but didn't like the crosshair look different a little i mean kind of there's a plus sign instead of yeah yeah yeah it used to be across now it's like a half-life doesn't it hold together with like a little bit of rope or something like that that is well you're so right man a little bit of room but like very thin like fishing line or something what did the 8x used to be called this is should be easy four times of course hold on hold on i got a very og question who remembers who remembers uh which gun which gun used to be better than the ak like a handgun it was literally better than two p250 no p250 used to be meta ak like the p250 okay uh when does the ak damage drop off start and when does it end i think anyone knows that that's not really good kind of like brought up this weird question about drop-off distance on aks i feel like he would try to like say that to throw people off it's a pretty specific question but none of us would know that because it's just it's too specific you know what i mean i get it i i i study for things it starts at 20 ends at 100. okay do we have any builders here what did you use use instead of door frames to build up stability uh pull like uh long poles yeah those pillars pillars yeah yeah i was always so confused i'm like go to the side not the center i completely forgot about those how many times has the ak recall been changed uh three times fighting two or three three times there was three versions three versions it was the first ak was like no skill to control i only remember no i don't think i remember two the second one was not no skill the first one was actually kind of skill you're still at the point maybe there was a first one when like like legacy area era but like i only remember two because i started playing like kind of in xp system at the very beginning there oh yeah here's a question how many different systems have there been like you know i mean like progression systems like five right like xp uh two at four well technically prince but like they've like changed it five different times because it started in in like legacy as like a bp system with the blueprint papers and stuff like that right oh yeah and then they made it components i think without blueprints and now it's i think it's been this version for like three years now this this is definitely the best version of the game yeah i like this version okay okay real quick because it's about to end i have one last question who here remembers the very first hazmat suit iteration not not the legacy one the one after that me i do yeah it was so cool and it had like a big like fishbowl helmet it was awesome i think duskin because he was very antsy and moving around a lot like it's just weird using my big my big noggin because i have big brain i picked up that duskin was he was running around he was like all over the place he was he wasn't standing still he was like means he's kind of nervous if he's constantly moving uh we do not have an elimination right now we actually have a tie porgy and duskin are on the chopping block and they'll both go into a 1v1 rock fight to see who will get eliminated from this game right now we need the street fighter music i don't know i got i've got more than seven thousand hours i think i talked the most so maybe they're trying to get out the person trying to talk the most but i think i put a lot of good points out there but people just don't want the smoke if you believe the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward now all right we have majority we're going into round three okay which metal door uh had the weird lock on it what you'd like we had weird lock placement wooden door wait like yeah wooden door because it was like in the middle yeah i used to like get placed in the middle i have a question what was what's your least favorite update from rust oh helicopter update xp changing it from xp or like the xp system no going into the xp going into xp yeah that was horrible probably my second i hate i i hated when they closed off the launch site building i like when they kept when they kept it open that was all right but that was terrible dude people why it wasn't so much what i like oh it's because all right for everyone who kicked me off last time as you saw i demonstrated my pvp skills you don't get pvp skills like that he didn't even get me below 50 hp so that just clarifies that i am a chad and am good at this game yeah you better be salty over there what is the best technique to quickly move uh quickly and silently while slightly submerged in water close prince if you actually do this yes yes if you do this you can it you don't it doesn't hurt i have a real real real serious question who remembers who knows that there used to be a quicker way to swim in water wave at me inside or some weird like that i never heard anything about staying faster i'm not sure but i feel like maybe not i'm really confused can you explain more about swimming faster because i would like to know back in the day like years ago you could like swim in the water like just in the water in the sea right yeah but there was a trick where you could you had to angle yourself like sideways and you could swim faster like really twice as fast yeah yeah i remember that okay i'm talking about three four years ago here what's the point of going in the water oil rigs in launch was here in the game bro do you guys remember what they have removed from the oil rigs what was the first rust skin the first first like the first rust was it anybody i don't know like like the first first first first first skin that was made by the devs like oh what was it i i can't quite remember it was either like one of like you know like the basic colors but he's like green one or i remember like there was this purple one like uh i forget the youtuber the checker marked purple and black like how was the t-shirt skin but i remember one of the hoodie skins i it was one of the earliest ones it was for a twitch streamer and it's purple and it has like white stripes on the arm and his name started with c i think 87 c87 something like that oh wow even i don't know that oh yeah yeah you guys are talking like stuff that happened years ago i started playing in 2017 and because i was a teenager all i played was rust stuck in the middle between uh porgy and mr couch potatoes because after i asked asked that question about swimming sideways those were the only two that were actually like oblivious to it i i would like to vote the old man but he clearly has knows what he's talking about probably have to vote uh frenchy ooh i don't really have any super sauce i almost think we got the one out already i have a bit of suspicion on glory so i'm gonna vote glory to be honest i have no clue but could be because they found out they have kids maybe they don't think they have enough time i don't know if you believe the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward now all right we do not have majority so we are going to end the game there if the fireworks turn green that means you have successfully voted out the mole and everyone in the box will win rough skins if the fireworks turn red that means the mole is still in the box and everyone else loses where they're coming i think oh god damn ah if the mole could reveal himself please step forward now then i thought we were good oh my god yes i thought i was gonna get eliminated and i didn't want that to happen,2021-07-22T17:25:52Z

0U2udJZm-ow,Rust Spectrum: Do All Roleplayers Think the Same? (Jubilee),19770,736,98,0 days 00:14:00,welcome to rus spectrum today i gathered russ role players from my discord to ask them controversial questions about role players and have them share their opinions these are real people real conversations nothing is scripted if you'd like to be in videos like this join my discord the people in this video are random members for my community today we're going to see if all role players and rust think the same i've been bullied or picked on by other rust players for role playing three two one go i mean when i'm role playing i'm usually like doing some cool stuff like setting up lights in the bass or like recently setting up music and everything and like having the mic in the base where like the speakers go all the way through and like you can yell the door campers so i mean if you consider that role-playing like everyone has fun with it so no one really bullies me in my group or in the server at least it's really cool uh i personally say strong ugly because most of the rest community is just a bunch of vanilla players and you don't really look at role players as like as something good okay i slightly disagree because at the end of the day it's russ there's always going to be somebody who's going to be making fun of you for doing something stupid so whether you're role playing or whether you're uh just playing the game normally i feel like there's always going to be someone bashing at you so that's why i disagree rust would be a dead game if it didn't have role-playing features three two one go so i don't think the game would be dead i mean i think there was a real strong community when it was just being a chad but like even the chads take advantage of the role-playing stuff like how many solos can get a hundred percent comfort without a chair so i genuinely think that while role-playing has its place in the game and it can be intermingled with the old playstyle i don't think that you need one in order to keep the game alive i think they're both able to do their own thing so when you're based near like the water and you see the sunrise and the sunset and looks all pretty when you have a box of aks you're just chilling like with your pals put down a chair put down a table put down some rugs like enjoy the moment without that like without that kind of like release from like the chad life i think the game would like suffer a little bit i think the game would die uh very quickly without role players because role players can make the game what it is because you always need some diversity between two types of players you can have the chads you have the role players so i think it wouldn't fully die because you know you have those chads who play like face punch main stuff like that but then you have the role players who like go on those smaller servers those servers that aren't really used that much so like if you think about it if all these role aspects were like removed and the role players would start to leave then it really it would just be those small servers that start to die off and like the really only servers you could play with other people would be like those big servers like face punch or rusty moves stuff like that just to build off of something um i think jayden said these all these items like it wouldn't kill the game removing them because back in 2016 if people had to get creative they had to use signs they had to like build bases in certain ways to make them all role play they didn't have all these certain items so it's something to think about like these items don't make role players role players like they're creative themselves i think jayden really put into perspective for me something i wasn't thinking of in the game of poker you need bad players so that way the good players have someone to beat same thing in rust you need to have role players that the chads can beat because if you just have chat on chad violence eventually people are going to get bored and they're just going to leave wipes early and you'll have you know partially dead servers i think as much as it sucks to say it being the small fish is good for the ecosystem of rust what i was trying to get at was i was saying that slowly over time if every single role-player item just period got removed a handful or more of the role players would leave the game or just stop playing on those larger or smaller serves um i don't think it would kill the game entirely like someone else made same point people can get creative and they can just find other ways to you know have fun in the game also with how big russ is growing i don't think there's going to be like a big huge knockoff of players if you remove all those items because so many people bash on role players it sometimes makes me not want to play rust three two one go uh i i get very easily disturbed uh so when someone really pisses me off for making like for something that i spent like hours on doing like let's say i made like a like a cool base or something with like a bunch of role player stuff in it and someone just continuously criticizes it and no nice things whatsoever it can sometimes bring me down enough to just not want to play russ for the day um yeah i just gotta say i kind of play the game for my enjoyment so if i'm off doing something like just recently we were playing on a server and i kept getting invited to go and do stuff i was like no i'm okay like i want to build my own disco floor and i just had a great time myself just being me you know it's a game i don't take anything that people say in this game personally or to heart if someone wants to say that what i made doesn't look good hey you're probably right but i enjoy it at the end of the day i don't think anything like that could make me want to stop playing russ if i'm being honest because there's so much to do on here you could even if you're not role playing you could do something else and i mean if someone's bashing you for you could just you know take care of them the old-fashioned rust way there are definitely going to be people that are toxic or people that you will not like i feel like that should be the mentality that you go in for every game that's a that's a big thing with russ because russ is known as a really big toxic community russ wouldn't be rust without that toxic community so i'm kind of glad that it's there but at the same time people that don't have the mental strength just should not play the game face punch should add more role-playing features instead of focusing on other ideas three two one go it would be a good idea because like it's i feel like what they're doing right now they're kind of focusing on one player base you know like with the people who just like want to get more loot raid people whatnot but on the other hand you know like you don't have to focus a bunch of time into it like maybe just a a couple things every now and again every update you know uh i completely agree with chicken they should definitely be focusing a little bit more on the other side of the player base because they are very one-sided with updates currently like i do like the dlcs and stuff but like i wish they added more items that wouldn't always cost money i have a hot take and i actually disagree with both chicken and jaden i i feel like this game has been really heavily favored towards role players like us because i mean every one of the dlc's has been real role player centric uh even some of the two twitch drops you got the hobo barrel you got the couch i mean a lot of stuff has been coming out as of you know my time playing rust that have been really role player-centric and i think if you alienate a group of your game like there's another game i play runescape that does not care about the pvpers and you're gonna kill off that section and i think while i really do enjoy all the stuff that's come out i think there's got to be a little more balance uh i agree with azer there's so many different things that this game needs to fix like as of this update even like the red tint the blue tint and the snow like so much potential for stuff other than role player items like i know yeah as azer pointed out all the dlcs uh have been role player oriented maybe like a pvp worried to the dlc but that would also introduce like a pay-to-win kind of style so i get offended when someone in rust calls me a role player three two one go there is a a big negative connotation with that word in russ especially just because people just don't think you're as good as the game as they are because you like to just do your own thing and not worry about you know perform an oil rig and everything so that's why i'm over on the agree side i gotta think i gotta say hobo you kind of gave me a different perspective on this i've always seen the term when someone calls me a role player in the same light as someone calling you a good actor if you're role playing and you're doing a good job at role playing that's kind of something to look up on but i guess you brought a different point to my head where if you're not trying to you know role play and someone calls you that it could be taken as an insult because they're saying that you're nowhere near as good as they are in the other aspects of the game so while i personally find myself on the other side and strongly disagree i can respect what hobo says and kind of see how it could be viewed differently i'm gonna take what asia said and yes normally the word role player is an insult but if you get called it enough after playing the game for months or years you just get used to it and you just take it as a compliment because role playing is not a bad thing so if you're playing this game and you're worried about like getting triggered and you're coming from the twitter sphere and like not not being able to handle an insult or two you're playing the wrong game so if someone calls you something you don't like like you gotta just shrug it off like it's rust most toxic community that can be like they call you like racist words they call you like anything under the sun like it's you can't just like be offended i i actually feel glad that you know some people call us role players because that means that the role player community has shaped russ so much that it actually gets around and if people want to use that as an insult i'll honestly take it as a compliment microtransactions run games you know profitability is always key who do you think pays for more skins from uh face punch do you think it's pvpers or do you think it's role players definitely definitely role players because i feel it can be split yeah it can be split because like fans spend money on like alien reds and stuff but yeah but you don't really get an advantage with skins those skins like the alien skins those aren't directly affecting face punch the only thing they care about is the skins that they upload weekly because that's where they get their cut from yeah and what are they upload weekly they upload a road sign set they upload door skins they yeah boxes bottle boxes as well but that can be used for zerg to identify what's in the box like those neon skins most every week like it's catered towards desserts and cord towards the chads i'm pretty like most of them most of the time like whenever i like hear the word role player i think of a player base that doesn't have like a huge amount of hours like as yeah like not less confident it's just that they don't they don't want to spend as much like money on micro transactions as people with like 2k to 4k like to like 10k hours this game and community would be much better if more people became role players three two one go the reason i disagree with that is because one there's already uh like servers meant for role players so if you're looking to do that you can easily find a server to do that for yourself however on a main server or server everyone's competitive most people on those servers are playing the game to pvp to get loot and on the slight chance that you come across a role player base it's kind of refreshing it's kind of like you see somebody playing the game and they're playing it their own way and they don't care what's going on around them so it's a nice little refreshing take from all the action that russ has to get has to offer you go into a main server what do you see you see the one lighthouse farms in the corner you see another one but like there's not too many and it's like a bunch of third bases and everything it's a nice balance add more role players it's like an imbalance in the force or something like that fire nation attacked yeah the fire nation's going to come down and like rain hell and everything i i agree and disagree with people on the other side uh hobo i slightly do agree with you i think that it is good to have different places and having specific servers for specific things makes sense i i really do disagree with you saying that you know this game is molded on toxicity and for that reason alone we need to stay toxic i don't think role players really need to stick to one role and not venture out and try any of the other monuments and whatnot i just think that why do we need toxicity in a game i understand that people do it it's it's always fun to you know talk crap to someone but at the end of the day like it doesn't make the server in this game a better place and just because that's what we've become accustomed to it doesn't mean that's what the game should be call of duty used to be really toxic and i think that as time has progressed i think it's become less toxic and sometimes even a little more inviting very rarely but i just think that we don't just because toxicity is how the game was formed that's not how the game needs to continue and i think that by having more role players in it you'll get more people who are not just willing to kos the second someone walks by i can see how like having more role players could be like on the bad side but i feel like it would mostly be good because as either azer said like we don't have to continue being toxic but like just add a simple amount of role players to some servers and stuff like that i feel like it'd just be better for like the community in general because then you have the people who are like kind of roam around with you not kill people just like have fun,2021-07-10T19:08:09Z
dLEcPeqirJc,"Rust, but farming gives you RANDOM ITEMS",336203,7518,261,0 days 00:10:14,today i'm playing russ but farming can give me any random item in this game as you can see i go up to this tree and hit it and it gives me a road sign armor i hit the stone node and i get a medium wooden sign anything in this game that i farm will give me any random item and rust now let's see how this goes alright well this is the first time i'm trying this plug-in and we're gonna see what this thing gives me today because i'm very curious on how this is gonna go right off the bat i do see some stone notes here so this is the first time i'm going to farm using this plug-in oh my gosh it actually works dude it's giving me oh i got a l96 from a stone node well i'm gonna finish this rock and see what else i can get from this oh my god i got a rocket launcher what is this i got a tier 2 workbench oh my dude this is 20p bro a rocket launcher a c4 and an l96 from one stone node now after farming that node this is what you're going to get from hitting one stone node some of this isn't the best loop but obviously some of this is insane loot now i'm gonna explore a little bit more and see what else i can find with this plug-in surely if i hit a tree i should be able to get resources from this right oh my gosh yup i'm getting i got a red key card i have two red key cards now so yeah pretty much any farming will give you any random item as you can see on the bottom right i'm getting literally anything in the game possible so as of now you can get anything random from nodes you can get anything random from trees now we're about to test what happens when we hit barrels and crates first thing in the crates it is also randomized and it looks like the barrels are also randomized i got a snowball let's see oh my god i got explosives from a little car park crate this is actually pretty fun because i do not know what's going to happen everything is so randomized like you just it's just the mystery that makes it so fun let's see what happens if i hit a mushroom oh my god i got thompson from picking up a mushroom oh my god so all these mushrooms i can pick up and just get random items sulfur i can guess that i can get things from resource pickups too literally any type of farming that you can do on this server will give you random resources in this game if i pick up cloth it gives me another secret labs chair if i pick up these mushrooms i'm getting high external stone walls simple hand sights also if you're a server owner who wants to use this plug-in or someone in general who just wants to play it on a private server i have this plug-in available on my patreon it's just a way for you guys to support my videos and also way for me to give back something to you guys well i think that's enough testing for me so let's bring in a couple of my discord members and have them try this out and see if we can take oil rig using this plug-in so what's going on do you guys have any idea of what we are going to do today no not a clue yeah no idea all right well today boys i paid a plug-in developer and there's going to be something interesting happening on the server but you guys don't know it when you guys load into a server what's the first thing you would do hit a tree hit a tree all right sweet well i have a boat over here let's go start farming so everybody follow me let's go monster oh what uh already this is farming and oh you have a c4 you have a singapore so guys if you haven't been able to tell already uh literally everything is randomized when farming when you hit a tree you'll get random items in this game when you hit a stone node you will get random items in this game if you hit a barrel random items any pickup anything is random you have the exact same percent chance of every single item getting in this game and our goal today is to take oil rig but we have to work together and share so do you think you guys think we could do this today we can we're taking oil all right boys all right let's go get some little boys all right you guys want to go exploring uh maybe go to a train yard there's a crate there we could we could probably unlock that and farm around there oh there's a bear oh my god are you okay oh my god run over here right over here close up video i caught some video oh no i think if you farm the bear you also get resources or you get random items i'll need a camera oh my god i think you have to go underwater yeah it's time for your rectal time oh god get away from me get away from me no stop stop please your prostate is mine oh please i just got that 249. you did let's go we realized we were going to need meds for oil rig now it was pretty much impossible to get syringes from farming but we realized we could get cloth from recycling clothing to make bandages uh just keep in mind when we take oil if you die it's gonna be very hard for you to get back so none of us can die here or else you're gonna be out of the equation all right let's see what's in this room let's go let's go okay red cards in here um finally it was time to see what was in the beloved china crate these crates are known to be insanely good so our hopes were very high we knew there was just something special about this one and something amazing was ready for us inside oh my god me and moise are kind of yeah that didn't go as planned after that horrible shinner crates and more farming we decided it was time to head to the satellites monument and it was a good thing we did because we found some interesting items that could help us take oil rig insane explode oh my god i got like a large loot bag and i unloaded it i got three high velocity rockets and five incendiary rockets okay well what is that that drop wait you got an airdrop oh let's go the legend owen himself somehow managed to find an airdrop and our hopes were back up again we needed something big out of this one after the failed china crate and we just knew something would be juicy in this air drop there was no way this air drop could let us down now it's not oh no it's down here oh my god dude look at the airdrop i know i know this isn't going as planned but don't worry we have enough weapons and it was almost time to take what's behind me oh my god i got a golden egg boys everyone gather around gather round gather round sorry i have a golden egg in my inventory this could be big maybe i'll bless the lords that i get something good out of this yes all right here we go oh all right it's it's all right it's just an lr dang it dude i was hoping it was like a rocket launcher man you hyped that up man i know i did i really hooked that up oh i trade you for that what is this why did you take a picture of my butt it was finally time to take oil rig but we had a plan walking into this first we had to clear out the regular scientists which shouldn't be an issue our main priority was the heavy scientists so here's what we were going to do owen here was the only one who was able to farm a rocket launcher we gave him all of our incendiary rockets and he was going to fire the landing pad in stairs to burn the heavies see this guy here that's toast he has a c4 ready to throw at the scientists before they start shooting at us moist was going to be on top of the red car building with a grenade launcher and greg and i were at the crane ready to shoot at the heavies finally we have slime he is our tank for this mission he'll be calling in the heavies and taking all the damage on the main floor now we carefully prepared this plan but with low ammunition we had to make use of what we had farmed up earlier all right daiko hit the button here we go boys this is the moment we have been waiting for good job owen good job all right start getting those stairs start getting those stairs keep firing keep firing killed one nice nice nice next another test oh my god yo we did it boys for real oh my god our plan was a success and in less than a minute we took down all the heavy scientists with no casualties slime was knocked down but we were able to pick him up now it's the moment everyone has been waiting for what could be in the oil rig crate after many letdowns of different crates earlier today we were really hoping this one would top off the others here is the moment you've been waiting for we have accomplished our mission today congratulations to everyone you guys can kill each other now no i knew it damn it hey greg,2021-07-02T15:40:03Z
yCeMGk78qHA,Rust Spectrum: Do All Rust Players Think The Same? (Jubilee),105135,4172,342,0 days 00:09:32,welcome to rust spectrum today i gather players from my discord to ask them controversial questions and russ and have them share their opinions these are real people real conversations nothing is scripted if you want to be in videos like this join my discord the people in this video are random members from my community today we're going to see if all rust players think the same rus at one point has affected my mental health or has caused irl problems three two one go i guess 100 strongly agree i've definitely missed things before playing in big groups wipe day is really important if you're not trying to get kicked you have to be on thursday every week playing at 12 in the afternoon and that affects things i uh sometimes i'd miss school sometimes i would not hang out with friends and then like on the weekends and stuff they'd be like oh come hang out and it'd be like 11 o'clock at night and i'd be like oh i don't want to get raided and it's uh it's weird to tell your friends who don't play rust like oh it's wipe day and my friends have made jokes about it like oh it's day for spency he's gotta go you gotta go play rust he can't come he can't come to us on thursday and i literally would miss out like main things i'd be a no lifer so i usually the builder and every group i'm in like whenever you're remaining a server like you're always on the builder's always there it's stress stressful you got to play like hours and hours a week i mean back when i was in deserves like i played like what upwards of 10 hours a day every day like for the summer missed out like going out with my friends got invited things i missed out do i regret my hours yeah i do but i feel like it shaped me as a person as well so i used to play in big groups like 70 man's 80 mans at one point there was a group merge and we played in 120 man and i was a builder i had to build this build these massive bases for them like absolutely huge something like 300 000 metal a day on a virtual service if you got raided at all and 9 out of 10 times you did then all the pressure would be on you unused like why did you design it that way like why did you build it that way and like you just have 40 or 50 people in your dms screaming at you i think it's very telling just like the different styles of play i come to rust as kind of an escape from life and i just come here to have fun and have a good time i think i i play rust as a more of a social game and it gets me meeting new people or i play with my irl friends and it's it's more of a place to have fun if i ever hit a moment where i'm not having fun i just leave the game because that's not why i'm here i enjoy the toxicity in rust three two one go oh yeah baby toxicity and rust bullying isn't needed this game has to be toxic the toxicity in this game is one of the things i love growing up in cs and rust and like all these toxic games where you just get screamed at has definitely shaped me as a person in life and i feel like it's great completely agrees well literally i'm a carbon copy of what he literally just said anything people say to me that is toxic it just bounces off my forehead honestly yep i mean i kind of agree with that but at the same time it just depends but i'm not one of those like screw it there should be no toxicity at all but there should it should be slightly dumbed down i was raised in the cod lobby era i mean i've heard nasty things said i've said nasty things but as i've grown i've kind of come to realize that i'm here to have a good time and if i was a pvp chad like i was in cod yeah someone talking crap to you is always a motivator to just wreck them and then you feel proud of yourself but as someone who can't spray a gun to save his life and rust i just realized that it's not really worth it and i just get upset over pixels well i used to be a incredibly toxic person back in the day and then i kind of just went for a phase in my life where i was like what am i doing it's like it's just there's no point in getting angry when you can just have fun in a game and so i just dumbed it down a bit and stopped being all toxic and it's a lot more enjoyable a lot more karma i despise people who role play in rust three two one go yeah i mean honestly i think role-playing is a big part of a game that's like rust where it's a sandbox game if you were to do something like call of duty style where it's all about the killing the game gets pretty stale after a while which is why they have to keep releasing a new game every year to keep people interested in it i appreciate that rust has it's a sandbox game you can play the play style you want and again i love it because if i get burned out trying to do a real wipe i can spend my next wipe just role playing and it's it feels like a totally new game to me i i exactly agree with everything as just said like it's one of those things where you can you can full-on try harder wipe if you want you can spend a house and hours and if you get wiped off the server then you can just like go on to a much more empty and casual server and and just chill for a bit because the servers i play on it's it's a it's a tiny just a tiny bit annoying like you're like you might have roman or something and you might find like some sort of like wood village day free or something on some high pop ak intent server or something so that's literally why i'm over here on slightly like just is it very annoying on the servers i placed mainly just because of the servers i play so i don't i definitely don't despise them i feel like it's a big word uh it's sometimes it's annoying to have real players nearby and sometimes it's cool to have them nearby i don't know i i really can't make up my mind yeah they're more prone to doing like i guess you would say low-skilled choices when i see a naked without a sash i usually will kill him three two one go i just kill all of them i i didn't see a point of them living to be fair when you're in like when you're doing really well in the way it's it's those interactions where you give a naked an ak you give a naked sar and just like make their day it actually like makes their entire like rust experience like for that week what's a sorry to you when you have like lots of vacants imagine you're just spawning on a beach and then you run up to a base it looks pretty loaded you get into a nice conversation with the guys and they give you some stuff and you go on to snowball off that i mean like that's got to be a good rust experience right not just being shot in the head straight off shaping a person's personality on rust is what makes them a good player and i feel like my first thousand hours of spawning on the beach and getting head shot by a guy who drops me an ak and then i go and pick it up um and then he shoots me in the head i feel like that just uh you know shapes you so i feel like it's needed in the rush community it is okay to door camp other players three two one go i'm slightly in between slightly disagree and disagree i think it's situational if someone door camps you then yeah totally believe you should be able to door camp them but again i play this game in a role-playing way i'm all about spreading that positivity so it's just a toxic thing to do there's a number of things to make yourself door camp someone it's like if you get killed by a zerg that like live next to your base or something you're obviously gonna door count them right like you're not gonna let that go around like just killing everyone don't if you just find a random guy's base and door camp it for no reason then that's not okay but if there's like a motive towards actually dog camping them like you've actually got an actual solid reason that i it's it's completely fine like if you're a zerg in your door camping like a duo that's just disgusting but like if you're a duo door camping zerg it's like gloom and said uh yeah i mean i think it's acceptable and something that people should actually keep on doing get deserved out of our servers that's exactly the same as me it's like it's purely situational if you're a solo and there's like a man living right next to you i'd say go for it because they're going to have gear you're probably not going to have gear you may as well see if you can grab something but if you're in an eight man and there's a solo that's parked up next to your base then what's the point of just sitting outside their door so uh yeah i actually agree with all three of uh gloom and harvest and owens points right there that's actually exactly what i was gonna say but i'm kind of thinking from it a uh a smaller group aspect um i've definitely been in bigger groups but like playing in a smaller group uh you always are trying to make plays and when you see a zerg next door sometimes door camping for your first gun is the easiest way to do it and then you don't have to door camp anymore after you do it one time you get an mp5 and then you just get the snowball but it's like sometimes it's what it takes to get uh to get big to the guys who all said agree and slightly agree or strongly agree what's the longest you'd be willing to door camp someone for ages i've done it for hours yeah i've broke down a guy's door before yeah was that enjoyable how do you play russ i mean why did we play ross like like we played to get more gear like you're just yeah if someone wants to mess with you you're obviously just not gonna let them get away with it it also depends what server you're on because if you're on a like a pve server you're not just gonna door camp someone for the hell of it are you you're gonna dog someone on high pop servers or medium bob servers that's fancy actually can you get married in the future oh we gotta wait for the countdown sorry,2021-06-26T15:49:54Z
CRtPYLUlLu8,Rust Odd Man Out 6 vs 1: Who Has Never Played Rust Legacy? (ft.

a legacy player i'm a legacy player i am a legacy player i'm a legacy player i'm a legacy player i'm a legacy player one of them is lying and has never played legacy rust before if the group can

subscribe button if you want to see more odd man episodes like this enjoy rust odd man outs boys hey guys who's the mole we didn't play legacy i want to start with the times when what time did you guys start playing rust i started february of 2014. i played around the end of 2013 and started into the new beginning of 2014 as well yeah same for me i think we can really figure this out by saying uh who here knows frankie on 1080p there's one person that didn't say anything that's hello i said yes imposter i asked the first question i started february 12 2014 i wouldn't twit i won rust in a twitch giveaway from the streamer assassinator 39. oh wow wow that's going bad okay has horrible flashbacks of medkits i don't know if it's danny or digly but somebody said the way they said i'm a legacy player as if they're like answering a question i'm a legacy player uh it's 100 flak we're in there we're all talking about legacy and he pipes up about how bad the med kits were what is he talking about he's clearly suss he's making things up it's 100 flak if you just look at mimio he's all about the rainbow and the flower head and his legacy wasn't about the rainbows that's just horror's environments get to the losers area man come on wrap it up i think i got eliminated by coco's offhand comments like he just brings up some random youtuber and saying i didn't know him we had a minute man what the danny let's have a chat show danny okay let's have a chat what's up what is your what is your what is your favorite monument uh it was uh small radiation because there was a lot of action you know okay okay that's fine that's fantastic i liked hacker mountain oh that was like a it was a hot spot you know that's a good question uh yeah let's pass that question on to mimia what was your favorite uh i don't know if this counts as a monument but i would probably say resource valley i used to call it node heaven back in the day okay thank you thank you thank you if you know you know okay you're going back in time here bro yeah yeah yeah yeah remember when you can get wood from trees i was waiting to see if anyone would agree it was a what it was a aisle how about you slime the only parts i remember i don't remember monuments or if they're labeled but i remember the smaller large rad towns but i do remember hangers and small sheds you could find yeah okay yeah okay i don't remember here's a question here's a question for everyone what does yeah oh yes okay slime i've got a question for you dude yeah how big was the tc radius i don't think there was a tc oh he's great okay i don't think there was one unless we were just playing out of all the medical items in there which medical item isn't in there or is it in current rust anymore green med kit wait no no red med kit the red magnet yeah the small med kit yeah yeah yeah this because it's a big one and then the syringe now right well those that spamming of the medkits dudes that was so much okay if we're going to talk about weapons what gun is highly popular right now that's not that wasn't in the legacy the ak yeah wait hold on let's add on to that what was the gun the main assault rifle gun in legacy baby these coming at me coming at my throat because i can't remember dog that happened seven and a half years ago i played it when i was like 15 figuring out how to masturbate okay if you found a weapon yeah you could find a certain amount of attachment slots onto it but if you put an attachment on the weapon could you still take him off uh you weren't able to take off attachments so if you put all this out of 250 you'd be stuck yeah you would be stuck yep um i straight up just don't like the guy he's shifty he's lying to my face i can't even wake up yesterday he's clearly never played legacy in his life except he did have the attachment question which actually checks out yeah delicious did you remember that i do have to say that in holdaceous defense i feel like he's probably one of the ogs out of all of us i feel like he's honestly i'm on the edge right now between uh danny and hodacious they did make a good point of hodages was quiet a little bit but danny didn't really speak up at times oh my god get him out of me scare me get the out and since all these nice english people you know are not used to it i think that's the problem but i can feel something spanning uh against me i think they're all spanning together if you believe the mole is still in the box and you'd like to continue playing please step forward now all right we have majority we're going into round three so i have a question and i want you boys to answer for raiding in a legacy how would you use the explosive charge place it right up to a wall oh you needed a detonator didn't you no oh wait no white white white white white i'll just bring it i'm pretty sure you just placed it down and had a timer like regular c4 but it was like uh it was like a deployable not a throwback this isn't ready yeah yeah yeah man there's no detonator i i don't remember i don't remember hey don't you remember the rad animals okay they used to drop nice loot they didn't bring it over to current ross i'm i'm offended i like the rad animals okay i can't that's why guys a little bit what about the zombies they were junkies but you can get med kits off of them that was nice oh how many pickaxe hits did it take to kill kevlar oh i don't know that one i never i think i genuinely just don't know how about this i love you legacy what's it a legacy chat man oh wait here's a good question sorry to cut you off like but no go ahead you didn't want someone to build up the side of your base what would you put around your base pillars i will hold those forces in the first he's redeeming my books right in the middle of the foundation i'm sticking right now we need to figure out who the mole is how about this does the mole know this for the famous yoka what was the name for it in legacy and if you know the answer point now i don't actually maybe you kind of know but i might be wrong i think i know i hope not i actually can't remember dude okay we'll say that two three and a hand cannon yeah i knew it yeah i don't remember it i don't remember it okay i just you know this is so much to remember like eight years ago i mean listen come back to like when we first started talking here how did everyone find out about legacy originally because i know for me it was the frankie thank you it was a friend for me and then i watched frankie 1080p and then i was like okay that's fun but then i got off or got off it for a bit frankie built a little house in a little pre-fab shed i think he was still on brazil i'm honestly leaning towards daiko slime because like i but then think think then i think audacious i don't know man this is a 50 50. i feel like we got the moles out already i'm voting for whole dashes because every single person in that room has proven to me that they have played russ legacy so uh we do not have an elimination right now uh we have a tie so what's gonna happen is uh both people who are on the chopping block are going to come up one at a time and they're going to have 30 seconds to explain and prove themselves why they are a legacy player so the two people on the chopping block are daiko slime and mr flack right so i am definitely a legacy player um i remember getting stuck in the sheds when the game first came out there used to be a door there and that's also the last time i also played legacy because i rage quit when i was younger i got mad and thought the game was bugged i remember research kits which you had to use on some items which you had to use paper um i remember putting wood shelters down every day and then not much else for a bigger base besides that remember the wood storage boxes are the biggest thing i have them laid out anywhere that's pretty much it comrades i appeal to to your oh come on no you don't get to interrupt me i i appeal to your good nature i recall specifically watching three of you people playing rust legacy and that's when i bought the game for myself one of them just shrugged the other one is very colorful and the other one looks like a mob gangster i assure you that i played russ legacy oh he got naked you were in one of my videos right i remember that that was so fun i had so much fun i had so much fun in that video if you believe the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward now all right we're going to end the game there if the fireworks turn green that means you have successfully voted out the mole and everyone in the box is going to win rus skins if the fireworks turn red that means the mole is still in the box and everyone else loses um oh hey it was flack wasn't it i knew it would it be let's oh i can't even talk it was black oh my god flak you up man the mole could reveal himself please step forward now hello oh my god my god i knew it just like hey everybody i'm mr black i was the imposter for today's game um i started playing wrestling about 2016. i used to watch funny enough holdaceous used to watch mimeo used to watch winster and i got into the the rest game in about 2016 and ever since then i've been hooked i'm not really a pvp i do like my buildings my exploits my glitches and at the moment i'm doing update

Tr8xBmwMJcQ,Rust Split or Steal the Skins: Can Rust Players Trust Each Other?,129552,4027,296,0 days 00:10:01,the number one rule in russ is to never trust anyone but what happens when there's money on the line i gathered random members for my discord and told him i would give them ten dollars worth of skins however they have to decide if they'll split or steal the skins with each other this is how the game works two players will be seated at a table and will have a couple minutes to talk and come up with a plan of what they're gonna do then they'll go to a garage door on opposite sides and have two decisions they can either choose the green t-shirt or the red jacket if both players choose the green t-shirt they split the ten dollar skins and both walk away with five dollars if one player chooses the red jacket and the other player chooses the green t-shirt the player who chose the red jacket takes away the ten dollars and the green t-shirt player walks away with nothing but if both players get greedy and choose the red jacket they both walk away with nothing will rust players be able to trust each other when money is on the line that's what we're going to test today slime do you trust me yeah it's hard to say all these skins look tempting i got my chicken sandwich by my side so i'm more focused on this chicken sandwich right now than focusing on skins the best option if we wanted everything we want if we split it we both get a five dollar skin and that's exactly that that's exactly or 55 cent skins honestly dude i think it's a win-win if we split in them knowing that i have no idea what a ten dollar skin is for us now because it's always 20 or five most likely have five dollar skin exactly man exactly after that talk with slime uh like how are you feeling are you actually going to choose the split option or are you gonna pull a fast one into steel what what's your decision right now and see i've played on your survey and you know i'm cold-hearted i'm not nice but slime seems like a nice guy and i'm ready to risk it just to be a nice person so you're going to choose the split option yeah all right so slime uh after that talk uh it seems like you guys are deciding to split but is that the real case with you what is your actual decision um i think i'm gonna go with uh stealing because with stealing it's a win all or win nothing kind of deal so you never know if the other person is trustworthy even in russ alright gentlemen i talked to both of you and both of you seem very clear on your answers i'm about to open the door and we're gonna see the reveal three two one you i knew it this is nah i'm done that welcome to rust bro you see fancy this is why you gotta be a cold-hearted wow daiko i said i was gonna be nice i could have been a girl water you all right if you look at my head it's a picture of a chicken another word of a chicken is a you got covered my mindset i had a feeling that he was going to go with split because i really do not have any damned idea of what a 10 skin is and rust only five dollars but 10 that's where the big money is i am kind of like a jerk in a rush because every time like when i first started i'd always get like over i kind of just like you know what i might as well treat everyone the exact same way i wanted to change be nice but yeah he did me wrong there so i guess i'm going back to my old ways man yeah i mean i think it's plain and simple we just choose split listen we choose split we both go home with uh you know some skin so is what it is yeah it's not really like it's 500 like pounds or like dollars or whatever you know it's not exactly like loads so it's like i don't really see any point in stealing it's just kind of like weird so uh yeah i was thinking yeah we just split it's only five dollars yeah i trust you yeah i mean i trust you i hope it's the same yeah i mean yeah i'm not gonna really steal for like what it's worth obviously if it were more then maybe i'd be like more tempted to steal them whatever but yeah i don't really think it's worth stealing just because then that's just kind of like kind of dumb yes yes the green shirt the split right yeah yeah yeah it is uh i'm actually gonna split you know i'm an honorable person you know i i trust i have trust in weights so let's see if he uh if he has the same for me let's just say right uh the red jacket has been picked that's that's all i'm going to say you know listen it kind of has to happen just because i i know i said i'm going to split but i know he's going to steal if he's not and if he splits i want to feel kind of bad but i'm going to also like kind of find it funny but i'm like 90 sure he's gonna steal anyway all right gentlemen i talked to both of you and it seems like you guys are very set on your decision so i hope it works out in your favor i'm gonna open the doors in three two one listen i am so sorry i am actually sorry like listen i just couldn't recently listen i didn't want to be in your situation that you're in right now situation i am genuinely sorry but i did not want to be in that situation yeah i was yeah i didn't really feel tempted about stealing i to be honest i didn't even think about stealing it because you know i thought that we would just you know split it go home five five but you know clearly he had a get other plans i mean i feel kind of bad at the same time it is kind of funny i i thought i'd rather get like nothing at all than than just get like played like that so before we do any debating i just want to say i'm going to steal all right sam so if you click spit if you play or pick it after the show i will pay value five bucks all right is that a deal um no um i don't i feel on the news split how about that would i get out of it nothing ooh so we're at our a little bit of a debate here or just both split you know we can but what happens if you don't split i'm only two i want to win you know indeed no matter what i want to win so are we going to both skin this split are we both going to steal we're both going to split i mean why would we steal i'm going to put my trust into you and i'm going to i'm going to choose a split he's convincing me to split so he's probably going to pick steel because he wants to win no matter what so i'm just going to give him the tenon split oh i'm stealing i get this money man i don't know what about that guy but i hate that guy man you hate him i just want all the money man all right gentlemen both of you are very clear on your decisions so we are going to open the doors and reveal three two one yo gg man oh baby any words you guys got to exchange after this oh no actually i'm glad that someone actually went out of this ramp is any words that you have to say to donut i mean um easy money you know oh dude well i think it's it's all right like it's it's a game at the end and he won fair and square uh oh yeah i'm totally happy man i i got away with the big bucks you know that guy's a loser he just lost like come on you gotta think smart in this man i don't know how old are you man 17 oh dude i'm literally two weeks from 17 right come from my family poverty i need this to pay for my internet bro no about that where are you from i'm from i'm from texas bro what about you texas dude you live in you in the u.s bro i live in estonia post soviet country dude dude no no if you if you want to play the poor game here you know no bro i literally had everything ruined bro storms in texas wiped me and my family out all right estonia is thriving over there all right nothing like over here really are we really starving you guys you got you guys got those what's it called those like help packages or whatever extra money stuff all right give me three reasons give me three reasons you should like get the skins well first off like i said my family is in poverty i need to go buy some gum right wait wait you're gonna use the skins to buy a gum is that what i hear all right all right second good reason is if you don't split you're gonna end up like this guy oh that's tough dude i don't wanna be that guy you do not wanna be that guy a third good reason is you see this torch me and my family i don't know we're hitting people all right we'll punch you down we'll bonk you all right okay interesting interesting now i'm gonna i'm gonna let him have the skins you know yeah you know he's an everyday best player i i have i have a good community behind me i'll be fine with the skins even though i don't have that many but yeah oh wait wait one more thing one more thing go into discord z team discord yes sir team discord link a description he didn't seem too trustworthy he was he wasn't much of a talker if anything i bet he's going in with the ride or die kind of mindset i bet he doesn't even care if he wins he's just trying to take me down i think i think he's going for red and honestly if he's going for red i'm going for red none of us are winning here all right gentlemen after talking to both of you it seems like you guys have made your decisions so we are going to reveal here now three two one yay okay that's fair bro let's go i get my two packs of gum dude you seem like a nice car dude you deserve it uh no i'm happy with the result it was it was fun it was fun i'm feeling both happy also a little kind of sad and i'm sorry bro but i mean i'm both happy since you know i get my two packs of gum and me and my family don't have to stick a torch up this dude's bum but anyway but i'm also really sad because i was fully expecting him to go with the red so i was ready to go ride or die well ladies and gentlemen this video just goes to show that no matter what you cannot trust anyone in rust every single group that was matched today ended up in a steal not a single group decided to equally share the skins i want to conduct this experiment again so if you're interested in playing join my discord because all the players you saw today were random people in

F6a6xx2d0Ss,Rust Shark Tank: New Ideas That Can Be Added To Rust,48849,2261,139,0 days 00:13:41,so before you see these rust players pitch new ideas that can be added to russ i want to thank russ ignite for sponsoring this video russ ignite is a new skin gambling site with lots of game modes fast support and tons of giveaways you can also use my code fancy which will give you a free 50 cents to gamble gamble responsibly and make sure you are of age welcome to rust shark tank where everyday rust players have an opportunity to pitch new ideas to be added to rust anything from new items monuments animals and more the entrepreneurs will have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to present their ideas to the sharks it's up to the sharks to decide if the idea is good enough to invest their own scrap in but first let's meet the sharks shark fancy orb a self-made rust entrepreneur known for capturing nakeds and forcing them into a slave company everybody get to slaving right now go get me nodes go shark moji a well-known role-playing rust youtuber who secretly keeps hostages in his basement and sells them to the mafia shark jabroni he made all of his money killing nakeds and gambling their scrap at bandit camp he now runs and operates a successful horse meat factory shark monty owns 15 mcdonald's franchises and is currently being investigated for tax fraud shark lor a self-made billionaire dominating the fashion market with his hit skins lor now spends the majority of his time skinning nakeds of their flesh in the hopes of starting a fresh new cannibalism trend now that you know the sharks let's see what the entrepreneurs have to present to these millionaire investors first up in the tank is a young entrepreneur who hopes to implement a monument that has green blue and red key cards alright so my idea is a green blue card monument so the idea is you go through the first door and there's going to be one scientist and it's like the oximes layout there's going to be a green key card and then there's two scientists in these hallways and then you put the blue key card in here and then there's seven scientists in here and four milli crates in the room with the red card i'm thinking maybe thousand scrap you guys will get twenty percent oh i think this is a great idea because there's a lot of people out there who try to speed run oil and you made a great point about like just getting those quick cards so you're saying that i can get green card and blue card from this monument oh and red card yeah honestly drip i'm ready to give you an offer right here right now because what this is this is going to enable a lot of pvp because a lot of people are going to go here even though it's a small monument this is going to be a hot zone and that's what people are looking for they're looking for new and exciting monuments where there's there's going to be pvp and a lot of action and a lot of loot because that's what happened with the train tunnels i don't know if you sharks remember but when there was tunnels introduced everyone was down there and that was like the best week of russ in a long time and that brought a lot of action and a lot of pvp and a lot of loot so i think that's what this monument is going to do so drippy i'm actually going to give you exactly what you're looking for so you said 1 000 scrap for 20 i'm ready to do it right now all you have to do is take it off my table and you got a deal the deal is right here in front of you will you take it i will take it go ahead i'm thinking you should take it go ahead no one else is going to invest in this go ahead hold on hold on hold on let me let me listen listen wait wait wait wait wait hey hey drip drip listen the offer won't stay the offer won't stay here forever if i pick up the scrap i'm taking away my offer so you either listen to jabroni or you're going to listen to me so what is it going to be scrap back up then it's not a real offer and he's not being honest with you tripp i think i'm gonna pick this scrap up i don't know if the offer will be there once you pick up the scrap it's yours there you go drippy thank you shake shake my hand trippy you made a great decision drip we're going to make so much money with this idea before you walk out of the room let me say something to you i like your idea i love the idea of investing in real estate and ross but i don't like what you said about helping people i don't want to help people i want to make money so to that end i'm going to make you an offer even though you already know no no no no i'll don't give fancy the thousand scrap he just gave you and i'm going to give you 3 000 scrap if i can own this monument exclusive rights and i'm going to cut you out for three thousand subscribers what are you saying tripp don't do it look look look i'm taking that deal that's right that's right we're knocking that's right drip is putting a lot of effort in this and we're gonna boost this and we'll see you guys next update because this monument will be in the game oh no let's go honestly i think drip and i are gonna make so much money with this idea it's such a great idea and drip like don't listen to those other sharks they don't know what they're talking about thinking we're gonna make big diamonds out of this up next is an entrepreneur joined by his wife who plans on bringing new concepts and additions to the bear trap what's up sharks i got a snapchat and it's ready to go bear trap this is my wife and we're looking for 10 investment into our company so all i'm asking for is 1 000 scrap i prepared a presentation for you guys today what's up sharks i have a product that is totally super to invest in this cool product has all sorts of uses it can defend your base from stinky zergs you can prank your friends running around the base and it has so many more uses so what do you say sharks invest in bear trap this is not not a scam all right wow very professional as you guys can see uh our bear trap is world renowned in the rust community so far we've opened up five vending machines across official servers and we've sold over 100 bear traps for five scrap apiece really it's really simple and easy uh for for the customers to buy these so i want a demonstration if you'd like oh she's immunity it doesn't even work yeah so wow isn't your product supposed to work yeah this product isn't even working you really try to scam so i'm no mechanical expert but i'm not impressed here confusion our prototype no no you showed us a great pitch awesome video and i i was ready to invest but your product doesn't even work like you you literally failed on live television here and honestly like for that reason i'm out oh okay um any any other sharks wanna you know yeah you really trying to milk us with that video man i'm sorry but i'm out i'm not getting scammed today i say you rework on that new version that captures bears and i'm in i i see these everywhere like what do you have a patent on this how is this different than the the bear traps i see all over the place right now other than the fact that it doesn't work and the ones in the world do oh well the reason the reason why this product is a defect is because my wife crafted it yeah it's my fault i'm sorry well i appreciate the fact that you're a businessman who hates women that's going to go far with the gamer audience but uh your product doesn't work so for that reason you got to keep that yeah same as everybody else really your product doesn't work it's not new and i'm out all right sharks thank you for your time i think that the beer trap was defective um it's just a mistake you i think that's what it was i made it and i'm not very good at making stuff next into the tank is an entrepreneur who has new plans to add a new feature to all armor and rust why hello sharks uh nice to meet you all i hope you're all having a wonderful day have you ever wondered about your clothing especially during pvp times and war times and farming times you've got to change all your clothing out don't you you've just got loads of different sets that you've got littered around the bases everywhere well i hope my idea can certainly influence how that has changed my idea is modular plated armor the way it works is you have a piece that will go onto your chest or your leggings and it can slot in plates these plates can be anything they can be cloth they can be wood metal it can be high qual and they can be used to slot in and out and you can put up to three pieces of your select item in said plate and it can be used to upgrade the defense of your character but the more you add obviously you're going to have downforce to them say if you have full armor with full heavy metal then it's gonna weigh you down a lot and it's gonna make you very cold but if you have an armor piece with lots of wood and lots of cloth it's gonna make you nice and warm and it's gonna give you decent protection at first i was thinking this might not be a good idea with like the armor because like there's already armor plates out there but then you brought in the question like you can place different materials in the slots because like a lot of people have the issue in the cold where they have armor but you know it's it's good armor and it gives you good protection but you're too cold and then you take damage from them that gets really annoying but i feel like with this invention you can put warm clothing in there while still giving you protection and not having to lose that health from like the coldness for example i craft the clothing and then i can insert the raw material of high quality to make it a high quality armor or cloth to make it a low tier armor the armor will have i'd say up to three pieces that you can put into it so you could potentially put two cloth and one high quality and that might balance it out but then again you're also going to have the weight aspect on it which may either hinder you i feel like with all these new otv players coming in especially with the new one that's about to hit july 1st i feel like a lot of new players are going to be confused by this concept they're going to look at the armor they're going to put on themselves and they're going to forget or not realize that you can put resources in your armor to give you protection and i feel like it's just going to add a lot more confusion to these new players the games are very confusing so for that reason i'm afraid to say i'm out but good luck to you ah thank you you know i think the idea is actually really creative the fact that you can like stack three things onto your chest so you can basically honeycomb yourself i actually really like your hat which i which i wanted to talk to you about i was willing to offer you 10 scrap for that hat um make it 15. i'll do 11. 12 uh 13 sold all right i like your idea i think this is probably useful but your presentation was by far the most boring one we've heard today we've had someone try to sell us grenade launchers we had somebody design a new monument we haven't had one guy try to sell us a bunch of crack so i just can't get excited about this business idea so i'm out so oh and how much percent are you looking for officially and like how much money or how much scrap do you want uh 750 for 25 percent that's actually not what that's that's very good wow that's a good idea and i hope that it hits the mainstream okay you know what you said 750 i'll give your hat back and 750 scrap yeah uh i'll do one thousand or twenty-five percent oh buddy buddy i'm going what he was asking for i think these guys are all under appreciating it i will give you 5 000 scrap but i want to go 50 50 with you whoa oh and you have a lot of decisions here what are you gonna do you have three offers on the table and two sharks are out what are you gonna do before you make your decision before you make a decision just know that i am in the fashion business i have been in the fashion business for 25 years monty hasn't even touched fashion he's in the weapon industry i will turn this 1025 into a million within two years i would i'd like to take the man with the cool hats off her oh let's go oh yeah thank you wow wow there you go congratulations here's your scrap like i promised i looked over to doing business with you man you too thank you oh we're gonna have a bright future together man trust him well i'm excited that i managed to get moggy on my side he's a really good shark and i think that we can go really far with this idea yeah man when when owen came in there with his idea you know he didn't have any flashy video like the other guys but that was actually the part that intrigued me because everyone else was trying to show off their little flashy images and videos but their product was stale now owen's product was actually super unique and i really liked what he was doing with the armor slots and i think i can even add even more into that with the fashion stuff that i'm into you know we make a good team man i think together we can take over thank you everybody for watching shark tank episode 1. if you think you have a good idea that could be added to russ and you want to give us a pitch go ahead and join my discord all the people that you saw in this video were my discord members and they came up with a good idea so i put them in the video in my discord is a sign up that you can fill out and i'll be choosing some people for the next video thank you guys again for watching and i will see you in the next

COr364ky5fA,Rust Odd One Out: 6 Roleplayers vs 1 Chad (Jubilee),95975,3375,290,0 days 00:17:47, all right boys listen up if you want a free 50 cents to gamble right now and try to win some rough skins go over to russeignite.com and use code fancy it's a skin gambling site with tons of game modes fast support and giveaways i want you guys to win big with this 50 cents today i gathered 6 role players in rust i am a role player i am a role player i am a role player i am a role player i am a role player i am a role player i'm a role player one of them is lying if the group can discover who the mole is they'll all split a prize of rough skins but if the mole is still in the box by the end of the game he will win all the skins this is odd man out in this episode we're actually introducing something special to the contestants you'll see in round three all right all right so anyone come prepared with any questions i've got one question when did you guys consider yourself like an actual role play like when did you guys stop roleplaying about my world before when i met farmer greg minecraft yeah i think minecraft or gta 4 kind of uh solidified my role-playing status yeah yeah minecraft here as well i think what made me a role player was after playing for a couple hundred hours i just realized it's a lot more fun this last time yeah i know what you mean i can do a lot more with the game like for what it is actually what's your favorite thing is being a role player i think trolling other people yeah just making a community like having a village or something like that building buildings different from everybody here and i'm going to say i like opening up car dealerships that's kind of quite honest that round was a big cluster and the only person that i didn't get a read off of was dhe everyone else seemed to have a pretty solid answer to the questions we were asking personally i think it's dhc he farted next to me and his part just smells sus honestly i kind of think it's oreo art what you were saying didn't really make much sense i mean to be honest i really don't know maybe at the beginning i guess it was really sauce okay all right um got i got a really simple question for everybody here if you could have any one skin in the game right now what would you get doodle garage saw it on youtube skeleton skins i gotta go with the friendly hat i need to go with a fish hat the original christmas lights i think yeah that's what we need okay how many hours you guys have i have one thousand six hundred i have one thousand one hundred and forty i have one point two nine eight hundred i almost have twenty one hundred i have four hundred and eighty six what'd you spend your rust hours on server-wise or what do we do let's say solo duo role-playing pvp et cetera et cetera i mostly do a role play with my friend i play solo but then i end up picking up some random person on basically every server i play with uh i uh i play with my friends and uh on like trio servers and pvp what was like the best role playing like moment you you guys ever had oh yeah okay can i stop me my friend we were like really really really bored so we started like a kind of slave empire so we we got a lot of farm but we also had a lot of fun so we had like pool and stuff and then that's the one thing i really missed out on i wish i got the pool party pack i only actually let me ask this any what dlcs do you guys have if any i'm deported tony i have the instruments dlc nice have the instruments in the sunburn i don't have any of the dlc's i gotta say i used to not have the instrument dlc until i almost cost my friends their base by bagging someone in to make me one and then i was forced to buy it all right i got another one what's everyone's favorite weapon uh the tummy i gotta go the crossbow dude that crunch is too nice yeah miles away tommy is really reliable but compound bow you can make like crazy plays if you oh yeah a little bit sounds super toxic for me but mp5 yeah that's literally the only guns recoil that i can handle that's the same i'm with them sprays better than them if i spray with all my powers uh i can barely handle the uh ak spray and m249 is not even like worth trying like i never get them 249. i mean it's not hard i mean it depends on the people too it depends on your teammates low pop or high pop servers i don't like zergs i personally play on a noob server that only allows uh up to trios those are vibe i play on like um i normally play on uh canada face punch one oh so it's like after white look at you after like a week it has like less than 100 players there's still a little bit of action but it's not like you're going to get rated by like a zerg you know i'm sorry is 100 people low pop from white from what i hear it's like i play on like 20 pop okay 20 pop is really really low let me give you guys i usually go 50 60. i play on a ice cream 5x just because i don't i can't be bothered to get all the materials on an official server real quickly so yeah you can get stuff real quick on a 5x and you can it's a lot faster than the days or i know it's just it's so much easier to do what you want to do you can't be restrained like electricity wise that takes so long to get you can just unlock all blueprints immediately when you log on to server i feel like carbon shots at one moment had like this moment of delay like he needed to make up something that gave him my vote i think azer's us because he's the most experienced out of all of us besides me bringing a lot to the table that i think more of a chad would uh focus on instead of a role player i'm thinking oreo because he didn't talk that much yeah i think i got voted off because i started like changing the subject because i didn't know what pop is i totally forgot what it was i had to search it up just to be part of the conversation and i think because i was like messing up my sentences after that if you believe the mull is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward now all right we're going into round three for round three we are actually introducing a new player come on out danny denny is a new player being added to this game and he could either be another mole or a role player nobody knows i am a role player danny tell us why we shouldn't eject you from the spaceship i mean i've been trying to reach out to you about your car's extended warranty but haven't been really successful lately so that's why i'm here today i heard there was a leaky roof as well but um i think really it's all about the enjoyment you know i mean that's what ross is all about um at least one of the options better at first i was really spooked and scared but when he started talking a bit he sounded really nice and i feel like we could be some good friends one day i don't know what questions you guys were discussing beforehand but if you want to ask me anything i'm more than happy to oblige so uh what what what's your favorite gun in the game uh ella okay okay uh what service do you play on uh usually restore 5x i used to play the no bp server kind of new to the game still i only have about 500 hours started a couple months ago during quarantine uh but lately i've pretty much been mining the uh the the one with the bps um the one that you could play the bps on on restore i'm gonna be honest there's probably a lot of cess on me but you know it's fine i just think uh because all those questions are about me and i don't even know what they discussed beforehand but i think if i keep blabbling my mouth like a true role player i am i mean would you like to do with your time interest uh so usually because there's a 5x survey right you got i just put beds all around the map and on destroyer in particular they have those little red raid circles so if something's going on spawn naked talk to them maybe grub a little bit but really it's just role play in that aspect would just talk into them um and when i do have loot i'll just build a little car base um usually by the road or something like that desert where all the world new carpet it's called uh so on restorative 5x no pp or the bp7 all the parts already there so i don't even have to worry about that i just need the components for like the um it's like a four or three and then there's the cabins so danny coming in was a bit of a surprise i don't know where he was hiding this entire time um but i gotta admit right off the bat with the grilling we gave him he was coming off pretty sus um he seemed to be pretty good at pvp and preferred to play in a more you know chad like behavior so he definitely tipped me off and i think he made me change my vote okay let me excuse danny if you could have any skin right now which one would it be if i could have any skin uh i mean what's that six hundred dollar skin that's like a face plate the big grin yeah yeah that one yeah he's in it for the money he's in it for the chad face okay it's just i'm really ocd about my skins and everything like that right so i got the polymer skins blackout skins the camo skins just kind of something uniform right so i just have to have the complete set personally in my mind i like to role play like oh i am deserted on ireland i'm a military person uh last one i've got where did your role-playing history begin uh me being at pvp so it gives me no other option but to just run around like a prince but like only in rust or have you been a role player in other games besides this i've played other games but it's mostly like call of duty battlefield 4. i mean a fallout 4. i had fallout 4 but it's a single player game um so i just download a bunch of mods and build stuff like that but the 70 fallout 76 was totally let down so never downloaded that where you guys is uh not just for you where you guys are favorite monuments to build next to bandicam definitely the same or outro mine is outpost literally just for the piano honestly for me it's water treatment plant or train yard like every time i build next to a road i i like get off and like log on a couple days later and my base is like never raided how big do you guys usually build your bases you buy two at the max yeah only two by two dealership then that'll be like a six by three okay that round danny it seemed as if he kind of had like a script in front of him it was a little sus uh i think i was too quiet this time i didn't really have any space to talk this round because danny talked a lot if you believe the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward all right we have majority we're going into round four i got a really really dumb question but uh how active were you guys on the twitch drops uh twitch drop was my first one i don't really go for the twitch drops unless i really want it like the ninja of course i go for it so that's the only one i went for and everything else i just leave alone because i don't care about all the weapon skins i only go for the skin i really want i was trying to get that um what's it called the garage door one with the the girl on it from the last one but i was about 20 minutes short otherwise i don't really watch twitch so it's more like you know if it's on my youtube recommended or something like that i'm like oh okay there's twitch drops going on but i don't really follow it who are some youtubers you guys like to watch some rust youtubers i think everyone can say spoon kid after the baba boy a little bit cringe to me you hate okay you you you i'm just i'm just saying like i just like realistic things okay you know someone running around in a dog like gonados yeah frost is probably my favorite but when it comes to who's that trap based guy who just yells at people in in the mic it's like that spoon kid actually spoon kit has that soothing voice it's just he's always isn't he always solo so it's kind of you know like an ardo either no i like i watch a night off these eggs but that's pretty much it i personally love fancy or best rust youtuber this this this is a paid promotion fancy orb what about what about what's your opinion on um stimpy i like his trolls unrest what about you i've heard of the name but i can't remember a specific video he doesn't only do this that's why since since i'm joining in light here if you guys could just say really quickly your hours victor what's your hours 1.3 marshy uh almost 2100. four six okay isa or 80. you guys have less hours a million that's kind of when you have dennis interesting 519 last i checked anyone here play on any pve servers at all i'll just play the eating it's a favorite environment only so though you can't kill anyone else ah i tried it a bit but it like it got rid of my trolling vibe sometimes you know yeah i think that would be boring to be honest with you oh but there's no guns or anything like that no there's guns you just have to fight against like some have zombies instead of you know okay one of those uh i saw a stream about it once but i just wasn't interested in about it i think i'm gonna be voting for victor to be honest i forgot how many hours he had but he just seems a bit too confident you know like uh that's that's the only stuff i can put right now is um i want to go out with victor this time he's laying back a little bit he's behind what everyone else is saying the majority rider hand so we actually have a tie this round so what's going to happen is the two people on the chopping block are going to come face the audience and tell everybody why they should not be eliminated and why they are a role player are the people on the chopping block are danny and victor um okay um uh most road players they make farms i also make a farm i guess i'll tell you the farm design which i use normally i start with a two by one as like so i can put my loot then i make the three by three um with the metal shop front and uh reinforced windows uh you put sprinklers four sprinklers like in the center uh hemp pretty good you can make berries berries are really good hey guys uh so to be honest with you i mean i was using british accent whole time this is my real voice right here but i just wanted to counter the other things like this is role playing like why are you building a farm base like what do you need the hemp for right i mean you can make a bed and breakfast or a car shop but you don't need loads of hemp like that sounds like a clan farm bot type of thing like i don't know about that i think i might have over committed on my role as a role player just too much confusion too much suss i'm a wild card what can i say if you believe the mole is still in the box and you guys would like to continue playing please step forward now alright we are going to end the game there if the fireworks turn green that means you have successfully voted out the mole and everybody in the box is going to win ruskin if the fireworks turn red that means the mole is still in the box and everybody else loses oh what congratulations to the mole i'm just blown away how if the mole or moles could reveal themselves please step forward now carbon shots was the mole the name wow i voted for that man hi my name is carbon shots i'm a chad i only like to raid i usually go with a group of six friends we just run around killing people with aks i actually have 2.1 k hours and i just feel bad these guys got outplayed by my superior intellectual abilities feel bad dude you really killed the vibe in there thank you everybody for watching rust odd man out

iZt-lPUxPnE,"Rust Odd Man Out 6 vs 1: Who Doesn't Have 5,000+ Hours (Jubilee)",171969,5901,636,0 days 00:16:32,today i gathered seven players who have over five thousand hours in russ i have five thousand hours in ross i have over five thousand hours in rest i have over five thousand hours in rest i have over five thousand hours i have over five thousand hours in rust i have over five thousand hours in rest i have over five thousand hours in rest one of them is lying and only has one thousand hours if the group can discover the player who has one thousand hours the all-splitter prize of russ skins but if the bull is still in the box by the end of the game he will win all the ruskins this is odd man out oh okay all right when did you guys start playing rust 17 and i've been playing ever since then 2016 2014 i bought it 2015 but i started playing like the right over 2015. okay okay i want to ask a question a quick question right how do you obtain the frog boots all right by staging the most likely or something like yeah yeah yeah something like that okay okay okay you can get it from the stage what was the last like did you know that how there's like bp wipes after it's like what came before that it was before the fp white i mean i had 60 seconds i didn't have much to choose just winging it and going with harvest i mean the questions are pretty good though tell you that i don't think anyone's suss in particular i think i'm just going to vote for i got a gut feeling on just the man with the dragon mask i honestly did not pay attention to names that much my strategy in that round was to just ask as many questions as possible just to like solidify that i have over five thousand dollars in rest i i played i don't play myself it's because i made too much noise do this i made too much noise man okay all right i want to start off with asking a question right to all of you um as of recent what has been the most populated server in rust sorry story i mean yeah with 775. how do you crouch and get like be faster without making any noise sprint uh yeah spins crashing yeah but i mean you still make noise though that's the thing like yeah i'm actually good at it i think it was patched like a few months ago that's not patched there's there's no way someone thinks that was patched so crouch walking definitely isn't patched nothing was in patch notes about it so if you think it was patched he may just be a new player maybe a mole the m92 around which time did that one get a recoil like before it was just straight ahead i don't remember but i know i was when that came out it was literally yeah you just said about it yeah frost are you talking about the fire rate or the actual recoil because the recoil was yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they know that they changed like 2018 i'm pretty sure or maybe try 2019 2019 what is the only gun not to get a skin in the game so far yeah we were just talking i'm not going to have anything too what gun just got a skin for the first time oh yeah they all know blackout black i don't know maybe we should go one by one on people because we're having like group answers you know it's harder to pinpoint well in that case uh ethical i'm going to ask you a question all right what is the largest clan server in rust currently where most of the big clans go to like the zergs the 20-plus deep group okay i'm gonna be honest here i literally just play rastafari umaine i always play that i played it for four years interesting i don't i don't go around on different servers okay well that's fair enough i guess but that's fair yeah i guess i'll ask happy boy what do you think the largest clan server and rust is currently i play modded servers i play two x's so i have no clue baggage do you know uh vital man yeah all right you're right you're right have any of you watched verdigo's raid camps yeah probably yeah yeah that's what got me interested um the tgb versus sin rivalry like that what is okay let's go down the line what got you into rust we'll start with bam um basically just watching vertigo's videos like you said honestly it's been like five years at this point i would have no clue probably saw some video by rhinocron shirt i don't know somebody who made something on legacy so i got it from a friend uh he posted a youtube video and uh watched it and uh yeah i loved it ever since mine was i was playing dayz arma 2 daisy way back and i noticed because back in the day in legacy they had zombies so i was like oh cool a new zombie game i want to try that out and then i ended up just really loving it and then they removed zombies bam when did you play like what year uh early 2017 like junish what's the fully upgraded like blueprint fragment oh that was blueprint fragments went out in 2017. that was the just it was a 2016 i think it's early 2017 wasn't it i'm gonna be voting for bam uh yeah he's a bit aggressive um i think harvest but just because he just talked the least that's basically it to be honest probably because i only play on one server and actually played on russified umaine for literally all of my hours so if you believe the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward now all right that is majority we are going into round three here i'll start off um the hoodie i'm wearing right now is charitable rust 2018 um does anyone know how much it cost on the steam market or like it like a rough estimate it was a interesting question like i stopped playing how much was the other one i don't know to be honest i didn't buy them it was like it was like twelve bucks fifteen but it was dude it is that were priced whatever it was because they didn't even cover once yeah is it just like fifteen dollars each i mean yeah it's just in the market right they're not marketable no they're not but anyway what's the charitable arrest 2017 skin no i don't know i didn't even know there was a i don't know i don't know i didn't follow skins until like it was like the stud punk one you know the it was oh there's a charity because you got crohn's disease yeah oh that one that one glowed that one glowed in the night and you couldn't no it's like the purple one with the squid does anyone know any other youtubers that stopped playing i know one counts yeah frankie um pc but he stopped just uploading full speed yeah i don't even remember him playing rust i know he played dancing yeah he played really well yeah he played like a few episodes of russ but never really got into it bam what uh video says fadey 82 upload i've never watched it however you say his name faded yet i've never watched a video we got a question yeah you were the only one not to walk forward i mean i thought it was ethical so wait wait happy happy happy happy let me ask you a question how long have you been playing restful since legacy but i've gone periods where i haven't played name name and place on the legacy map name of place yeah that's a terrible question i don't i didn't i didn't play that much of legacy but no uh that's fine where there were uh like monuments but they i don't remember if they had names or not i know there was one with the big warehouses um in like all the garages so i basically my first 3k hours in rust i played on a server where quarries are still enabled so if you if you played when quarries were enabled uh back then what did the stones look like the model and game when you threw them on the floor yeah yeah yeah minecraft blocks yeah literally men what two gun models are the same model from legacy that are still in the game revolver i have no idea i have no idea no p250 is nowhere near the same model it was like p2 was black yeah oh yeah p2 was like black the m4 was like a military m4 what color used to what color were the hazmats in legacy bright s yellow yeah there you go honestly i i don't really know i i asked the legacy question and i thought it would catch some people out but um i i guess happy i don't really know he kind of hesitated but then he did ask some good questions after like it's really hard to tell i think bam is pretty sus he's only been playing since 2017 that's four years have over 5k hours is pretty pretty low chance he's been probably no life in the game if so uh so we actually have a tie the tie is between happy boy and bam what's going to happen is happy boy and bam are going to come up one at a time and you're going to have 30 seconds to explain why they have over five thousand hours in russ all right the reason i have five thousand dollars in rust is because um i love survival games i've played survival games since dayz arma 2 mod been playing a long time playing main main reason i started playing was because frankie on pc i don't have too much knowledge on legacy because i didn't play for too long i don't know i i i don't think i i'm not good with words i have over 5000 hours in ross because you know throw any question at me you know regarding the current meta and rust or anything and i'll be able to answer it i've got really extensive knowledge from 2017 upwards quarries etc i just don't think a 1000 l player would have that i invest in skins i just love the game in general i don't really play any other game except rust i'm playing it like straight for three years i've got 500 in cs but that's basically it i think i got voted out because i stumbled my words i'm not the best articulated i guess so uh i guess they didn't like my way with words i kind of just fumbled it man i fumbled the ball if you believe the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward as majority of you are going into round four all right i want to talk about why i want to talk about i want to talk about why i didn't step forward then basically because the other people that voted out didn't answer any questions pretty much i mean for the most part and all of you guys seemed fairly knowledgeable right i mean you know all of you answered which servers had the most pop and rust or related like jen's really every time we voted he stood back thinking them all was out but i feel bad because i actually do think he has 5k hours he just wasn't able to answer simple questions for uh a 5k hour player i mean that restoration was a week ago i mean you're scrolling through the browser you can see the server you know what i mean on twitter a lot of people are just you know they're locked on you know modded servers 10x is like you know when i had 1k hours in rust like i was just playing 10x as roof camping like that's you say you've been playing for three years straight like if you're if you actually have five hours there's no or over 5k there's no way you haven't taken a break you haven't taken like long breaks from rust that's one of my favorites when i say straight i mean like i've this is the only game i've played really uh i'm pretty sure i'm the main suspect because i didn't i didn't go forward in two rounds in a row so they all thought the mole was still in the box and honestly if i want to be super safe then i could have just you know gone with the majority but at the end of the day man like i don't know i'm just gonna go up my gut and say the mole is out of the box and you've done that you got like over five k hours in under four years yes yeah what's different about pumpkins and corn now uh pumpkins give you a lot more hp than they used to right am i wrong or right about that one elaborate why why they give you more calories i remember the change when there's something different no there's we're not talking about stats or anything major change in the pumpkins that's a very niche question no it's like i feel like i would do it yeah i agree the only one that has to answer i mean okay you answered saber all right no no no i don't know i'm gonna say i don't know okay i may harvest it a big change for like all the crops i mean not specifically pumpkins but you used to be able to plant them on top of each other and usually be able to get like hundreds of them like in one spot so that that used to be a big meta that's that's true as well but i don't know i don't know this one is it i'll can i answer it yeah let's see so before they didn't stack they used to have health bars on the side to show like how actually good they were you're right people used to make lag switches out of boxes it all explode do you remember the day the day when code lots broke bam you remember that yes yes yes what color did you put in what code did you put in to break the code i don't that's a good question i don't know the card because i i know i remember i didn't play when it broke but wasn't it four zeros then you spammed harvest more a little bit because i just don't know one thing about pumpkins i remember that like i remember how corn and pumpkins used to have health bars and stuff like that i mean come on just one question i've been answering questions asking questions the entire game and then they're just going to target me over one like stupid little fact that i forgot about like come on what servers do everyone's playing right now quick quick quick point i've been getting bp's on a main because i'm going to solo it but i also played roster us we've only got like 20 seconds uh face punch smalls because bps don't like noticed i play this casually so like modded five hats or moose occasionally i i i play moose and blueberry i mean come on we all targeted bam just get him out of here i mean it's better safe than sorry dragons and saber i think they're they're solid they they know what they're doing i know i'm safe so i would honestly just stick with what i said before about like how i thought the mole was out i just wasn't going with a majority you know they all looked at me and they saw me not wanting the game to continue i just got targeted from there i guess so if you believe the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward alright uh we're going to end the game there if the fireworks turn green that means you have successfully voted out the mole and everyone in the box will win russ skins if the fireworks turn red that means the mole is still in the box and everyone else loses oh let's go oh well played boys jesus christ stressed out over one question about pumpkins come on bro if the mole could reveal himself please step forward now what all right hello my name is happy boy i do have 1200 hours in russ i am a legacy player but when i first started playing the game i kind of hated it but i learned to love it and really got into it in around 2018 2019. thank you everybody for watching episode 4 of rust on man out it seems like you guys love this series so i'm

PcKFD1uykD8,Rust Odd Man Out | 6 PvP Chads vs 1 Roleplayer (Jubilee),127519,4875,382,0 days 00:11:36,today i brought together seven rust chads who are really good at pvp i am a chad i am a chad i am a chad i am a chad i am a rust chad i am a shot i am a chad one of them is lying and is a role player if the group can discover who the role player is they'll all split a prize of russ skins but if the mole is still in the box by the end of the game he will win all of the rough skins this is odd man out all right so because i think that this is like a gameplay style thing i kind of want to the first question i want to ask is like when you first load into a server what monuments do you uh go for uh i got a junkyard usually outpost and get a compound bow in my opinion if yeah if you're playing if you're in a team yeah on wipe day in clans i'll tell you what you do you go to a river you get a lot of food then you go train station once everybody is a ton of food right and then you can control the server because you'll get tier three very quickly yeah i'm interested what what what monument do you guys think is the best in the game i mean uh a lot a bunch of crates chinook can land there i mean i think i'm gonna vote for that frostbite guy just because like he didn't really say too much really at the moment i'm gonna go frostbite i just kind of like have a feeling you know i think i'll be voting for wade's because you know i i don't think he really spoke a lot that round yeah i think candy's pretty so i mean he didn't really talk much i'm going to vote him out i thought it looks on the youngest i'm also very energetic all right uh what service do you guys play on restoration before as well i play rusticated two times i normally just play official i play face punch two can two when you play fist punch two yeah it came to two yeah yeah yeah i mean i used to play it i used to play face punch one at eu a lot but the thing is with that there's so many cheaters and it's it's up that server is so bad with cheaters that server so that's why i stopped like playing that yeah how many hours do you guys have thirty six hundred um four point five four point five have any of you guys have been on like any highlight channels like rust highlights or anything like that uh no no yeah yeah i was on rust highlights actual channel like twice and the other guy's like once or something like that but that that was the end of 2019 with a gl play and then the rest two were like a 1v3 ak and i don't know what it was i ran a clan before i was highlighted by this dude on wipe day there was like two guys and he killed like six of us granted i was the only one that got a kill in my team do you guys play with clans or you guys like small groups i i prefer to play with smaller groups i think it's just a lot more organized yeah i got some more real friends i play with pretty hard to find an organized plan but when you do it's worth it oh yeah yeah like mostly it's just like 15 16 year olds who like i think they're sick we're like mp5 and and it's just kind of cringe do you guys trust youtubers yeah i like frosting i never watched froze because like i once watched one of these videos and find out it was scripted and i will like this kid and i'm just never watching it like they're so good yeah but it's not going to help you it's scripted no he didn't used to he said it at the end of the video he said at the end of the video and a lot of oh so you were angry we're like well they got kind of like saying like that it's kind of misleading all that can i ask you guys um you guys like play a lot of aim train servers like you can and stuff yeah has anybody here like ever like done scrims or anything like that oh yeah yeah do you guys know the command they used to like increase your outlook speed no no no no no sorry well i'll just tell you it's like head lerp and then you can like increase the number and it makes it super fun i'm thinking about v for dyslexia and the only reason is because i don't think he talks that much i'm going to be voting for v4 dyslexia because he didn't really talk that much and he kind of just agreed with everything that people were saying so we actually have a tie the two people that are tied frostbite and dyslexia frostbite and dyslexia are going to have 30 seconds each to explain why they are a chad and rust all right so you know a question i asked earlier about seeing people in the water i didn't get a chance to answer it it's graphic stop wave zero so is that an oil rig because i mostly pvp on rig the binds in the console you can do change the sensitivity i use that you do like bind mouse one plus like attack two and then you enter your two different sensitivities i feel like i'm a pvp chad because i pay highly pop servers and i'm a trio so it's quite hard to uh get guns and stuff but i find it fairly easy i also know keybinds but i don't know about that outlook i feel like that's quite useless to be honest i just feel because i was stumbling my words a little bit feel like i had good information but stumbled over myself if you feel like the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward all right that is majority we are going to round three i'm gonna be honest the only reason i stepped forward was because like i don't know i feel like the odds of us voting them all out in two votes they're there yeah yeah yeah using why i stayed far back is because i feel like it was the other kid who like just went out just because you know at first um i was like i don't know if you're saying but his explanation was kind of like all right i've got a question for you guys do you use their tend to go on oil rigs like larger yeah smaller yeah i use a large i mean large is a lot better oh yeah when was the small ulrich introduced in summer 2019 maybe like it might have been summer like may 2019 i think maybe around that time which was introduced first uh oil rigger cargo ship cargo okay there you go also i want to say the reason i stepped forward is because i wanted to see who's going to stay back kind of tell them i remember i mean if you think it's me just because i stayed by that's it's kind of dumb just because like i thought it was the other day i thought it was the other guy who just went on because he had no good explanation when he uh went up the second time so i just thought you know that's probably him do you guys like to play on high pop servers or currently play facebook nine but not i don't really play face punch one two or three just because start pretty pretty dead server first punch line i mean it's not something some kid tried saying facebook nine's like a dead server when like it's like 150 pop i don't really know what he's on about but i'm like then he was um he used to play on first punch too and i've played on that serve for like a year now and i've never seen him on there and then he said he played on facebook nine and that's a new server not very populated if you go for pvp you'd want to play on a popular server and that's a dead server but it's never full port it's not a photo yeah that doesn't matter the thing is when it's when a server is full pop and it depends on the map size it can be grief as especially if you're playing a small group like solo duo which i usually play i usually play duo trio and when you're just getting stomped on just by loads like he clans like over and over again and gets old there's just like no point where do you play facebook servers do you not like because the blueprints yeah they don't wipe and pretty much you know some wipes i i want to hop on and like not have to sweat you know the for like babies what do i prefer to raid with yeah well like biomes do you guys like living the most or does it depend on the map for you usually the planes it depends i'm building near a tier two or tier three monument i hate playing in snow too many rooms in snow i mean it's kind of like for like fighting whatever but i don't know if you're living in snow my man you can make fish farms for animal fat and then you can have hemp yeah i've never i've like it's not that bad i don't know how that works i feel like wades really wants to stay in he definitely has a lot of knowledge about the game for sure but does kind of have that role player mentality i want to be voting for wade's again because he did mention that he played on face punch 9 and that is a pretty dead server like i don't know what i mean none of these guys have any idea what they're talking about i got targeted from the start of last round for no reason whatsoever i explained myself perfectly fine and i just got like kicked out for no reason it's whatever they decide you know it's and you know if you believe the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward now all right uh we do not have a majority so we are going to end the game there if the fireworks turn green that means you have successfully voted out the mole and everyone in the box is going to win rus skins if the fireworks turn red that means the mole is still in the box and everyone else loses by not stepping forward i'm so sorry it's frostbite me dude sniffer right it's not me it's not me if the mole could reveal themselves please step forward now i knew it was oh my god oh i was gonna do i like the role play because i i think rust is great in general because there's so many great interactions you could have with all the different people and role playing really brings that aspect out of course you do have to get sweaty sometime but i don't get sweaty enough to be considered a chad have probably 2 000 hours on the game of just straight role playing it's very ironic this just goes to show that sometimes the role players can beat the chads thank you everybody for watching episode 3 of odd man out i'm definitely going to be continuing the series but i can't do it without contestants if you are interested in playing in an odd man out video go ahead and join my discord in my discord i posted an odd man out application where you can fill it out and potentially be in a future video i'm definitely looking for more players and people who can help with the series so if you're interested go ahead and join it thank you again for watching the video and i will see you in episode 4 of odd men out,2021-05-18T16:50:08Z
oB-P6btEyWI,Rust Odd One Out 6 vs 1: Who is the Solo Player? (Jubilee),197907,6991,522,0 days 00:10:58,today i brought together seven rus players who are part of different clans i am a clan member i am a clan member i am a clan member i'm a clan member i'm a clan member i am a clan member i'm a coin member one of them is lying and is a solo player if the group can discover who the solo player is they'll all win a prize of raw skins but if the mole is still in the box by the end of the game that person wins all of the ruskins this is odd man out hi boys all right who's got the lowest hours how many hours 1.1 1.1 uh you guys aren't going to believe

crack is acting a bit sus he has three hundred dollars so he's obviously a no-name so no clan's obviously gonna take him so uh i think he might be the one out there i'm thinking i'm thinking man a noose that guy i don't know something about him him like while he's speaking like that i don't know just sound a little susceptible i got voted out for my hours because um you know i don't know 360 is low for a clan i'm in a small clan so they didn't really care about hours and i'm like good for my hours i wish i could show that but you know all right guys guys guys i i have a very crucial question what clan name do you use i use slt i use i use ot i won't say han so mana news what's your uh here your clan tag it's hush but the s is a money symbol all right new gary ot and you ghosty slt you johnny um i just go to looking for group tabs and just join the group and build bases and you blooming meow wait so uh what what youtuber do you guys watch by any chance um i like taunted obviously frost who doesn't yeah yeah yeah yeah um yeah you get tack i'm talking you know you gotta you gotta throw in the bandwagon h june of course uh he hasn't uploaded recently though i mean stuck in 2017 watching guys go god god rest kit queer are you not going to talk about that no no no no no no one cares about it i watch prince vids definitely i said i watched prince vids as a joke and i think they thought i was not lying and i was joking around they had jokes around here you can't be joking i'm looking for group post every time yeah wait who said that i must go there that's what i do well yeah what basically you guys building for your clients uh i use the just like the circles for the square around it or three by three usually yeah you're cool with this i use my original circles with the squares there's like a square right here and here and here it's like a the six things and you can multi-tc it with like six tc's and that's pretty cheap for like a chunky clan for a chunky clan john yes us johnny suss man this guy watch the friends foods oh yeah those look gary gary and johnny oh god i don't watch prince vid yo who who said they watched prince william wait so uh when did you guys start playing i started playing right and quantity i started playing 2016 well 2015 because i got a laptop 2019. i started playing around yeah yeah yeah sorry i got one my first game i got as soon as i got my computer was nah i got rocket league and i got around and uh real people got rust first only solo players wear riot helmets with a scuba outfit yeah that's no because you'd be scuba in the oil like you know yeah because he's solo i'm saying johnny's kind of sucks right now bro i don't know you're choosing everyone except for johnny that's how i'm feeling because separately just joins random ass groups if you have a clan why won't you just stick with the clan and edit like move people out of that clan or add people to the clan why are you joining random clans all right everybody so we have a three-way tie so what's gonna happen is the people that are on the chopping block they're gonna come up one at a time and they're gonna have 30 seconds to explain why they are in a clan so the three people in the chopping block are johnny sepp and main in noose um i'm uh i i build bases i have legit like a quarter of my hours in uh the sanctuary i i i just filled bases and excellent and then usually they let them come along raids it's really fun all right so i'm in a clan because i do not like being outnumbered on a bigger server so i usually try to play with my my irl friends some friends that i met along the way of my journey we're we're more of like a a pvp type of clan so all right yeah the prince video through the princess vids team was a joke i swear um it was a joke and uh can i like end my time short what's gonna happen is everyone's gonna do a revo except for those who are on the line i was joking about the prince vincent and that kind of me over if you believe the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward okay that's majority uh we're gonna go into round three all right let's what service do you guys i i i feel like i'm really sad so i'm gonna go first i have plans dps2x i played in a one final clan well i guess i'll go next uh i play reddit main uh i had an eight man then we turned into a 16 man so yeah there's 16 of us now and that's literally it i have their 16 ross uh i'll go i play on rory i used to play on rustopia but now we play on some vortex it's a community saver uh i used to play with a 22 man then i left the group because i was inactive for a little while then now i'm with a new group it's 14 men uh i usually play uh like 2x servers like stevias uh honestly stevias is probably the main one and uh you know rustic that's really the only two servers on all right boys i play on two x's i play on a rusty uh rust monster 2x and i also play on hollow servers 2x and i also run into like i'll mess around on a couple like boosted servers five exit 10x we'll around on those normally we have a main six as like the captains or more or less the leaders that'll run everything and then they have groups of fours decent size group 24. all right it's like 26 actually right now twenty six oh nice twenty six are you guys controlling the server uh on the five x and ten actually we play with the bigger group and yeah what base that's you guys use uh my group we do two by two or uh or after we get two by two and from some mats we'll go to a three by three design but that's it's pretty trash only has like two shells on it so we started recently going with burst gang's design it's a multi-stack atc floor stack base it's pretty far uh i use my my own base design basically uh we kept on getting rated because like the people already knew the base designs so i had enough of that just build my own mine's probably the worst out of the bunch we start on a one by two because hardly anyone gets on it white and then uh when more people get on we farm make a three by three the classic uh honestly i i i think the sus guy is johnny he's just i don't know the story just doesn't seem like batting up i think it was because i was wearing my my diving suit uh i think when they when they awesome when they heard me talking about uh i just joined different teams i don't think that was the right thing to say if you think the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward now all right that is majority staying back so we're going to end the game here if the fireworks turn green that means you have successfully voted out the mole and everybody in the box is going to win raw skins if the fireworks turn red that means the mole is still in a box and that person wins all the ruskins yeah good luck i can't tell oh they're not even lit let's go victory let's go victory if the mole could reveal themselves please step forward now thank you everybody

SSll1Q7nICU,"Rust Odd Man Out 6 vs 1: Who Doesn't Have 1,000+ Hours (Jubilee)",306158,13060,924,0 days 00:10:36,today i brought together seven players who have over 1 000 hours in rust i have over 1 000 hours in rest i have over 1 000 hours in rust i have over 1 000 hours in rust i have over 1 000 hours in rust i have over a thousand hours in rest i have over 1 000 rest i have over one thousand hours in rust one of them is lying if the group can discover who doesn't have one thousand hours in rust they split a prize of rough skins but if the mole is still in the box by the end of the game he wins all the ruskins this is odd man out oh god oh oh um all right let's see actually does anybody want to explain like what they do like um yeah uh so i mainly pay on 2x uh 1.5 x and 3x vanillas that's like op surge stevias and blue lagoon all that uh and i have uh about 1.1 k hours there you go um i i can't believe that because usually uh all players play on like boosted servers because they don't really have that much time to play anymore so i can i can believe that i bought does everyone know the command to make you jump higher no i know not really oh yes back steps back steps next steps like i forget it's my steps 60 yeah yeah that says a lot for me there you go all right go on come around all right i play i play vanilla mostly so basically i i voted for bedrock because uh he seems a little cringy and usually the newer players are a little cringy so that was just my reasoning and it was speed round so you know i'm pretty good at this stuff i got a natural talent to tell liars he sounded pretty young usually younger players have less hours but also in the list of names his starts with a it was a very quick round i don't know how i assume it was just a guess at that point because there wasn't much to go off of which is fair enough so this is just a bit unlucky easy question easy question back in the day right if you have a lot of hours back in the day you could build quarries and pump jacks when you did where did you live what was the biome you would live in oh god um since then i started rust in april of 2018 which is when outpost just got added oh dates before that so that started in like 2016 i think maybe 2017 so i don't really remember having that here let me just check uh i guess it would be in the desert you got it it was in the desert you because the pump jack would get its oil from the from the desert and then you'd feed the quarry it's uh i don't know uh what's a good question to ask oh okay what uh when you purchased rust was it because of content that you saw or just friends okay um brenda recommended it for me uh for a couple years or not a couple of years but a couple of months and i just was waiting for it to go on sale what about you bad car uh content it was well ended he's the first one i ever saw and when did you start playing uh 2016 2017 okay goose i got it because of one of my friends and i've been playing it since 2018 i think right i got into it because of i don't know if you've ever seen it but you know um oh what's his name the australian guy who made a video called dance with cheetahs no yeah it was in australia because that video came out about a week before i got russ and i just had my birthday so i had birthday money i was like this game looks awesome so i bought the game i was going to say have you guys ever seen the saltiest man and rust by faceless yes yes who hasn't yes you guys own ruskins yeah yeah what's your oldest red skin well what's your favorite red skin never mind what's your favorite rescue i want to there's this really really nice um uh nice ak skin that only me and my friends like because uh we call it the autism ak because it has a bunch of puzzle marks on it and it's uh it's really short it has no stock i think and then um it goes i don't know it's rainbow isn't it yeah it is rainbow it's a rainbow yeah is that really that old man so i was i think it was grey goose because he was the one that talked the least uh the person that is eliminated this round is aaron dog so aaron the reason the biggest reason why i got eliminated was the last round um i didn't know the max jump it was that and then it was also that um they had some really old questions like back whenever you could build the oil rig that you would have to go into a certain bio if you think the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward all right we're going into round three all right can i just say two things quickly right first of all why did bad car sound so relieved and excited when he realized that he wasn't out mhm yeah but you sounded like you had something like are you getting down why would i not be excited i'm not i'm not nervous about getting voted out because like it is what it is but then i know that you have lost by voting me out you sounded relieved because you want to get all the skins for yourself who want it i mean to be fair everyone wants free skins yeah exactly that's my point what serve what services everyone play i've already said one yeah i mainly play blueprints moose and dystopia i played this one this way i used to play uh savaz all the time samus was a really good one that's where i'm at okay how about this how about this why do old some old rest players when they come back to the game they crouch when they shoot the ak because when you use the crouch you used to affect the recoil and make it less drastic okay okay all right how about this how about this what did the laser side do the ak hold on hold on don't don't no one answered tim i want you to answer this one what the what did the laser sight do uh now let's recall it's more um what's it called the like the the bullets go less to the sides more accuracy who's an og rest youtuber oh god um og in my mind uh either well in or most recently one of the ones that i've been into but i don't know how og is i like frost but and blueprint they're they're all good i mean i have no quandary in any of them all right do you have a favorite rust video or anything my favorite rust video right now is it's the house of cards video by frost that's my favorite video do you have any old ones that you like that you might remember aside from those already mentioned uh no not in my mind no okay what about who who here knows the youtuber who used to make a lot of rust rp videos and then moved to tarkov and they've got around 300 and 300 to 400 000 subscribers does anyone know i don't i know who it is i know exactly who it is who is it it is aqua yes you used to run a server too yeah um i got a question about aqua what is aqua's old like like uh video chat for his merch oh i like cool clothes do you want no is is it blue or is it cool oh no um it was cool and then blueprint stole it by saying do you want to wear blue clothes there you go so i'm feeling pretty good right now i i haven't gotten i haven't gotten called sus yet but i'm thinking it's tim tim's i asked him i don't remember exactly what i asked him but he is like his answer was really bad that's all i know anyone else i think is pretty good i'm convinced down to a t that is either tim or goose i think that monty and bad card definitely have over a thousand hours but i'm not sure about houston too i don't know man i mean i i just didn't know what to say when they were asking questions because like i did not watch the same type of stuff as they did you know if you believe the mole is still in the box and you would like to continue playing please step forward now okay that's a majority is staying back so we're going to end the game if the fireworks turn green that means you have successfully voted out the mole and everyone in the box wins rus skins if the fireworks turn red that means the mole is still in the box and everyone else loses what color is it if the mole could reveal themselves please step forward now aaron was the mole i thought it was 10. i was close i was between aaron and tim i've always been drunk nice the exact amount of hours i have is 384 hours of rust and i've been playing for two and a half years now i was expecting to what's the cards you need for oil rig and larger oil rig and then how do you get green and red cards basic stuff like that but instead they hit me with questions like how to increase your jump and i had no idea i was pretty much screwed once i realized that they were going for questions that very old thrust players would know if you enjoyed this video and actually want to be a part of these odd man out videos go ahead and join my discord i'm going to be making more odd man now episodes so if you want to be in one i'm going to be choosing some of my discord members,2021-05-04T15:59:34Z

rwhJx9oIW-E,Rust - Jigsaw Trap Base 8 (The Clan #2),130735,4821,260,0 days 00:11:39, don't worry about it don't worry about it hey what's in there free face loot as you probably noticed you foolishly fell into my trappist now i want to play a game you see titan clinton a lot of people dislike you on the server because of your toxicity you make no attempts to bring friendships with anyone and you consistently bring others down for your own enjoyment this is unacceptable in my book and today i will slowly be breaking down the trust that you guys think you have i so think because deep down each and every one of you do not trust each other although it seems like you guys are all mighty and powerful with your big base and top tier loot you all haven't created a true friendship your greed and toxic behaviors consume you and that is what i'll be exposing today there are four levels to this trappist in every level one of you will die there are five people trapped in here so only one of you will be walking out of here alive so right now we're gonna start the first game which is behind you before we start who is the clan leader amongst the five of you that's me people girl newbie ah i see i see behind you are two rooms i want you to select two of your teammates one would go in each room uh no screw that one are you guys there you're a apartment oh you you going there farmbot get in there i've been with you since day one you've been this is why we give you hazy this is why we give you day one you have like 200 hours dude shut the i mean i up all of you and mp you wouldn't have any software without me trying to you want me to go find bro yeah get in there come on one of the bus walks out right please gentlemen who walked in the room take your seats each switch will turn on electricity and instantly kill whoever is in the room and you have to make the decision of which switch you're going to pull you must kill one of your teammates in order to move on and if you don't i kill everyone in this trap base live or die the choice what can you get what can you get because you ain't doing but you see that army you're wearing to see the cockpit helmet i'm wearing you see the coffee can coffee can't help but i'm wrong you can't see it there's a wall still bro come on stupid that's why you're a clown clown you should die not me that's why you're writing the hazmat suit i don't like running now we're going to have you guys you've got a box of aks we give you sorry yeah i don't like running ak my aim is bad i farm for you guys for a reason do it i see holy interesting decision you may come out i'm sure that was a hard decision newbie i'm so deeply sorry i had to make you do that however the game has just begun move on to the next stage this is so up though although this room looks harmless one of you will be dying here it's actually pretty simple the four of you are going to decide who sits in this chair you have one minute to choose begin easy all right i already knew no i didn't knew before we walked in here that i wanted to die because sleep your name is so bad i literally don't think you've ever hit a shot on anyone show me come on let's go just go farm some more man just go farm hell no dude at least i can hit a shot bro at least i can hit a shot slim sit in the trailer it's unanimous bro go go to the chair dude are you guys serious it okay in the chair you dude anyways but congratulations to the three of you please move on to the next stage what the what is this now you might be a little confused right now this stage certainly looks a little confusing allow me to explain what the three of you need to do and the romeo ran us over 50 campfires two of these campfires have a key in them which is your key to the next level once you find your key trade it through the window and you'll be able to move on to the next stage you just search for every campfire until both keys have been found however one person does not find their key will be left in the room to die begin searching now i'm gonna find that key before both you guys you guys suck at looting oh i got one hell yeah thank you congratulations youtube everybody you both move on to the next stage who's the but he was a anyways you both have reached the final stage in this game however only one of you will be walking out of here alive before we start i need both of you to take off your gear and drop your weapons onto the ground okay i'm not dropping my if you do not drop it off you will not move on to the next station none of you will make it out of your life now please find a chair and sit in it we are going to play a game of standoff in the chest next to your chair is a python that only has six bullets and between you are two garage doors you may not leave your chair and you must kill the man in front of you when i hit the switch to open these doors i'm gonna count you down make your shots count five four three two one i'm gonna dive come to the window congratulations newbie you can pick up your gear but leave your weapons to move on to the next room you can move on to the next stage as you can see all of your teammates have died as the leader of the clan i expected you to prove yourself more by taking more responsibility but greed overtook your decisions and you let all of your teammates die the captain always goes down with the ship yet you were standing alive in front of me now at the beginning of the game i said only one of you were walking out alive however there are two people from your clan that are still alive slim was alive the whole time in fact this whole trap base was a setup for you and your other teammates yesterday slim approached me on the server and explained to me that his clan was toxic and he wanted to teach you all a lesson hey you hey are you that uh jigsaw guy my clan is just so toxic and i think i i'd like you to teach him a lesson i agreed to help him however stage two was purely designed for him slim knew that you wouldn't put yourself in that chair and neither were the other guys so his stage was great for him to win i left a gun in the hallway behind you for him to execute you and i believe he has something to say to you you think you ran this clan i did congratulations slim i appreciate you bringing your team here you may leave thank you for playing the game attention viewers the next episode of jigsaw is the season finale of jigsaw season one the season finale episode is going to be insane make sure you are ready for it this does not mean it's the end of the jigsaw series i will

lYoUA1fvFsA,Rust - Jigsaw Trap Base 7 (The Deadly Pit),70337,2724,155,0 days 00:07:35,hello cornelius i wanna play a game take a seat cornelius i've been watching you on this server and the way you treat other players is unacceptable you are toxic to everyone you greet however you specifically target freshly spawned players for your own satisfication but when i decided to see this for myself i was shocked to see how you tortured these innocent players earlier today i witnessed one of the players you murdered so you're new to the game oh furious all right go walk down there have you seen the documentary where the baby bird jumps off the cliff well you're gonna be the baby bird go fly baby bird you force this player to the edge of a cliff and force him to jump or else you'd shoot him and take his loot i saw that player jump in fear of his life as he came crashing down to the surface but when you walked away i crept up and saved his life little did you know that player only had 10 hours on this game you made one of his first memorable experiences in this game unpleasant and i will not tolerate that now i want to play a game you will have a chance of freedom it could potentially leave this trap base with your loot however you must successfully come and play my game in order for that to happen and to start i need you to trade me all your weapons through this trade window for us to move on to the next stage nah bro make your own weapon scrub cornelius if you do not comply with these orders i will open these doors with the auditors behind them and they will instantly kill you following my orders will give you the best chance of walking out of here alive with your loots listen to me and play my game or dumb the choice is yours fine thank you cornelius i will keep your best session safe with me now please walk up the stairs and wait at the top for me such a stupid role player base welcome to the pet cornelius you seem this is a special kind of trap it's a new type of trap i've never done before however this trap has a very deep meaning to me but it has even a deeper meaning to someone else allow me to introduce you to someone this here is grey goose when i first started making trap bases to teach lessons to players grey goose was a part of my first trap hello grey goose i want to play a game his fate was in the hands of another player and butter dog has to switch to that tesla coil but unfortunately for grey goose he was killed because of his past actions three please please no no no no but to my surprise gracias returned back to my trap base to apologize it truly learned a viable lesson and grew from that experience so i decided to take him as my apprentice and together we built this trap base designed for you now since gregory's held to build this space he will be explaining what you need to do in order to survive since you like to make innocent players fall to their death it's only fitting that you do the same today the task is simple all you have to do is jump off the ledge and land on the furnace the fall is short enough so you won't die so technically it is a possible jump all you need to do is make the jump and if you can land on the furnaces i won't open the doors to kill you but if you refuse to jump i will hit the switch and open the doors next to you and blast you with shotguns live or die the choice is yours you you promised to give me my stuff back right i promise to not open the doors and kill you yes easy bro your trap is sucked you see cornelius i am going to keep my word since you were able to land on the furnaces i am not going to hit the switch that will open the doors and kill you but i know someone who would love to come on now this is the furious you tried to kill earlier and i believe he has something to say to you dude why'd you make me jump man he knows a joke obviously like i i of course knew you were losing the game trying to get you dude i was trying to get you some nice experiences for the game just funny times you know of course i was joking around dude come on that wasn't a nice experience man i was just trying to farm look look man it it was just for fun rust is a brutal game man you get come on you were just a little duck but you know you could grow up thank you for playing the game attention viewers after this video there are only two more jigsaw videos left until the season of jigsaw is over this does not mean i'm stopping the jigsaw series it just means i'm taking a small break but once that break is over season 2 of jigsaw will return with bigger and better traps thank you for watching this episode and make sure to join my discord because sometimes jigsaw can get a little lonely let's go,2021-01-23T23:06:39Z

-FU_qNk9INI,Rust Rewind 2018 - HIDDEN MESSAGES AND SECRET MEANINGS | *YOUTUBE REWIND COMPARISONS*,854,28,10,0 days 00:07:52,yo what's going on guys fancy up here back with another video and today we're gonna go over the secret messages and hidden meanings that i put in my russ rewind video but first i just want to say thank you all to who showed the support on the video i got a lot of great feedback a lot of positive comments and it just meant a lot and it's definitely my best video that i've ever posted on my channel so just want to say thank you for that i don't think anyone has noticed this first clip i'm about to show you i haven't seen anyone pointed out and i don't think anyone has seen it cuz it's just so quick so just roll the clip now did you see that you didn't okay roll the clip one more time it just the case you didn't see it i'm gonna pause on the exact spot cuz it goes so fast it's like half a second probably less than that but uh yeah let's pause it right here and yeah you see i i knew no one was gonna see this so i just decided it let's just put penis and see if anyone calls it out and no one has so far so that that's the first okay that's the first secret message that i put in the restroom on i know pretty impressive right the next one i thought it's interesting and it's not hidden at all but i'm sure everyone can get this part but the when they started doing the four night dances it was mostly for a frost in kcmo remembrance scene because we did lose two great rush youtubers frost in case you know and i put little signs saying we'll miss you and goodbye and so i had to throw those in because you know everyone has a little spot in their hearts for our boys kc mo and frost that we lost this next scene i'm pretty sure you guys seen it but only a couple people have pointed out it's the fruit of a love scene where he's wiping the little ball well i i was heavily debating this one i put the negative 42 zine because we all remember the scandal this year with frida wolff cheating or doing the admin abuse thing and it was it was a huge scandal and everyone was talking about it so i kind of made it so he was wiping off the negative 42 because he was trying to he was trying to wipe it away as if nothing happened i don't think he came out with an apology video either so i just i just put it in as if he was trying to wipe away his past but it's always gonna stay there because after we wipe the negative 42 so there's that that's the kind of that's the symbolism that i try to put in there next one is the soccer scene and i thought this was really cool but it's such a pain in the ass to edit i edited the twitch logo as a soccer ball and the scene kind of represents the twitch community i put the most i put the popular twitch streamers in there jackie coconut b i'm a bunch of other guys that i'm sure you guys recognize and so that was the scene just kind of remember the twitch youtubers even those kind of like a rush youtuber ramon i decided throw that in there because you know why not is it's a rust it's a rust rewind we got there everyone in there all right the next clip i don't think a lot of people realize the true meaning so go ahead and roll the clip first can i have a real wedding yeah might you can marry royal we'll wait what now royal wolf and dingy are actually married in real life and i thought that's really cool to put them in the royal wedding scene because they're actually married and they actually got a kid on the way so i thought that was pretty cool but yeah - great streamers there they were so awesome helping me with this and that i thought the scene was just perfect for them so that's the meaning behind that one that's it for the hidden messages and secret meanings but before i end the video i want to do a little comparison of the things that they said in the real rewind video and how i switched it into the russ rewind theme so i changed some things that they said but there they overall had the same meaning so i'm just gonna play them side by side and now you could see where i changed some things is that aqua i want help the vision over yellow hawk github yeah but no miriam pondered that part of us can i have a real wedding yeah night you can marry royal wolf wait what rewind needs more cyan can we do an experiment love that melting lipstick that happen even more that our faces can we add enough day love that electricity marshmallow needs to be in this video he was marshmallow how about julie bombo needs to be in this video here is bombay how about mr. wobbles what the blame to everyone who proved it's okay to talk about mental health this year and showing their viewers that it's okay to go through tough times like that to all the nakeds that screamed read this year proven this game keeps getting more and more toxic it takes a lot of bravery to be that vulnerable and i'm so proud of this community it takes a lot of door camping to be about toxic and i'm so proud of his community i think this year's rewind should celebrate the fierce fabulous and empowering art of drag i think this is rewind should celebrate the face and empowering our of going deep can we also give a moment to asian representation in entertainment this year major strides were made can we give a moment to all role players major strives were made this year and to the people who put aside their differences yeah and created something really special and to those who design new trap bases yeah and credit something really unique can we give a moment to working moms can we give a moment to the solo players i want to see all of you beyond kind of beautiful i want to see all of you for your own type of rest player i want to give a moment to everyone who supported me when i got sick all of the comments and messages i got made me feel like i wasn't alone we want to give a moment to all those who got the new rusty pot gear all the giveaways and ads made us the best rust gambling site that's it for today's video guys thank you so much for watching i've got a lot of ideas going on through my head for the de brest 2019 rewind video so if you've got any ideas that you want to share definitely leave a comment below if you also want to be in the restroom on video for 2019 also leave a comment below because i've got a lot of people reserving their spots already it's just gonna be so crazy but thank you again for watching and i'll see you in the next one,2019-01-13T14:38:56Z

sorry oh sure what i did alright now it's time to test out the scuba diving feature this i'm actually a little bit more excited about i don't know what's going on uh what's if there's anything underwater and what it looks like and yeah this is by the way this is a model server i just had to hop on something really quick can get a little gear seconds there's like four pieces he had to get so let's say i go in our butcher this is a new sound i like the new sound nice alright so i'm not sure what i'm looking for now i'm just gonna stop here and put on all my so i don't know if i just jump down there a surgeon just put the sun and walk really slow see i guess i just go jump let's go down oh my god it is dark down here i can't see anything i guess i'd just go down i can't really see anything i'm not sure if it's supposed to be like this okay i see something oh okay these are like little algae or some that there's this cloth at the bottom should go second i guess i just explore just look around alright so i see a rock over here this looks kind of promising so we're going to go over here see what this is all about okay oh there's a green thing on top of here wonder what this is it's like some kind of gem or something no no this is just reflection about dumbass oh i'm trying to see if there's anything down here i'm not exactly sure who i'm looking for i see a boat maybe there's like loot in a little spot you can store your stuff in the boat okay all right oh there's a box there's box okay so this is what it looks like oh you have to hold it eve this is really slow oh my god i'm gonna have to edit this alright so we finally united the box or untied the box and so i guess i just swim back up here and grab it alright let's see we'll see what's in this thing alright not too bad not too bad this is a mod saver by the way so it's probably gonna be something like that vanilla time to try look for something here i'm not exactly sure i guess i just looked for those boxes i'm not sure if there's gonna be any around here i see you or hear gonna oh there's a bird of there can i have mine this i don't think i can okay just check it was worth a try it was art the tribe i see above here this looks really promising so we'll check that out here's another another box here have to edit i got you guessed there we go so something like that i'm just gonna just gonna let that float up to the sun let's go ahead and check out what's over here it looks really cool well light in there maybe there's some good loot in the box there's a smaller one and i can't do that one actually you know ellis untie this i got you with the edit i'm not gonna make you guys way through that's pretty painful that's the same stuff in there another box up here what was this a large box all made second is this up oh this is a large box so it's probably gonna be better loot in here i assume yeah i can't get in there one else is done here can i even get in there yeah there's nothing in there so yeah this this place looks really don't - i like what they got going here well platformer with a whole bunch of boxes this is pretty cool i'm gonna have to untie all these i got you guys with the ed again don't worry time to see what we got here now this whole water ball here okay that's that's a little bit - all right so let's go see the first box so those look like those are like the better components on the big boxes and the smaller ones we'll get like the little crappier ones made some low grade not too sure but that's what it looks like i don't need that so yeah that's that's probably what it is bigger boxes give you the big loop yeah let's wrap up these three and yeah this is this is overall pretty cool up to a pretty big for adding things in mostly and to big things the monument and the fishing stuff or the scuba diving i'm gonna assume they're gonna add way more stuff so it's just this is just a little starter but that is it for this video guys if you enjoyed please subscribe and drop a like and i drop a comment to drop something nice and down below i always read your comments that's something i look forward to of on that it's been forever i'll see
