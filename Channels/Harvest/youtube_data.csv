xtQt6JyndaY,I Ruled The Largest Kingdom in Rust (Movie),893532,20302,827,0 days 01:04:45,since the dawn of civilization kings and queens have ruled their kingdoms and the earth leading the thousands below the mass of wars to either victory or death now these kingdoms did not come without issues but what if they are to be created in rust it all began a few months ago and fancy or pronounced that he will be hosting a village warfare server now this server was unique in that it was going to be made up of over 100 creators and with little to no rules and no group limit this was going to be chaos but i had a plan amidst this chaos and it all started with a message in my main discord i wanted to control the server and to do that i needed the largest village on the server so it began i recruited as many discord numbers friends even creators that i had trying to maximize the amount of people in our village and only three days later we were over 100 strong and that's when it flipped we weren't creating a village anymore we had created a kingdom   foreign  to start rolling the largest kingdom in rust you first have to put down the foundations literally where exactly well that brings us to the map and with this being well a kingdom the normal rust map just isn't worthy to represent something like this  with a more appropriate map we plan to build here avoiding the groups who have claimed areas here here here and here and so we all gathered at our designated area chopping down trees in preparation for the structures that we'd be building those structures being the main base we put here surrounded by walls and nets to it a throne room the walls of main base were up to specific group members to build as for me my task was to build the throne room i had already spent the past two weeks designing it building it and now i was in the actual server and if i placed it wrong it might be in the wrong spot for the entirety of the wipe  and the placement was perfect allowing me to continue my build and work towards being able to sit on an actual throne the design of the throne room was like no other and it proved to be far more useful than i'd ever imagined but this required lots and lots of stone a resource that is pretty scarce when you're building so many structures at once but we had a plan to fix that which was to use a quarry now cory's and rust are normally heavily contested mostly because they offer quick access to an unlimited amount of resources as long as you can fuel them and we were interested so i gathered my most trusted members who would later be known as the lords of my kingdom to control the quarries right off the bat and in a meeting with our core team i revealed the outcome of this special operation we completed a very special operation led by koala it will secure us a lot and lots of stone so thank you lord koala for completing that operation it was called operation usa we now control all of the quarries on the map we have infinite resources everybody start filling your roles start doing what you came here to do start doing law enforcement start going around to villagers asking how they're doing start doing your jobs let's go boys let's go let's go boys and girls i had mentioned roles now everyone in our kingdom had a role and mine was to lead the kingdom and keep it safe which started by removing an intruder on our island and after that i continued my other role which was to build the throne room and with the help of the newly acquired stone quarry progress was steady and only two hours later it was finished but that was only the outside we'd still have to decorate the interior but before we could something suspicious was happening in our compound  blaze blaze blaze who are you so talking talking voice talking voice come open the door that's not blaze that's not blaze that's not blaze that's not blaze that's not blaze you're not  blaze who are you who are you why is your name blaze away that's not him no no no but no please please logged off in the outside base okay so who are you so why are you tagged asleep come here come here come here come here come here i have tco open the door come on okay it's sir malcolm one of us where's sir malcolm i'm just curious because he's not tagged who are you sir marcus uh join general vc right now on discord you have five seconds who are you like bro just just come here this was the beginning of a long event of ghosting problems ghosting and rust is when you disguise yourself as a member of a group and try to make your way inside their base once inside you can take all the loot that you want and hopefully get out with it these two ghosters were impersonating the knights in our kingdom who are supposed to have access to main base and the code to so when they couldn't join the discord or open doors it was an instant giveaway and paired with the fact that the team ui limit was 20. you wouldn't be able to invite everyone in the kingdom to the team and avoid this so we just have to deal with it for now but we had something more important to deal with because afterwards when we were describing the situation to confusion we were introduced to one of the most dangerous groups on this server oh what the  i think that maybe confusion said these guys live to eat 13. so i went to check out their base and let's just say i did not expect what i found after only being three hours into the wipe their base was gigantic it was already equipped with windmills turrets and it was looking like it was ready for war they were also super close to the sulfur quarry one of the quarries i had my lord's tc off before all i had to do now was hope that they wouldn't attack us for doing so speaking about corey's we flew over the stone courts wallet in because it was a more valuable resource to us ensuring our control over it but the people who lived close to it were not so welcoming hey yo what's up hello what are you doing out here valerie uh you know i live all yonder by gas stations so you don't live at the island that you came from wasn't much of a talker but it turned out that she did indeed live at the village that she came from and that village known as pickle island would later be interested in taking control of the stone quarry but we now had extra stone to finish the throne room so that's what i did completing what i started in making something worthy of a king i placed rugs chairs tables anywhere they seemed fit and it all started to come together all i had left to do was to place the banners behind me and then my throne the one item that was absolutely necessary as a king  and then it was finished  the structure that took wheat to design in hours to build was finally complete this one room would go on to be the symbol of my right to rule and my legitimacy as a king as long as it wasn't raided and wasn't lost it would be soon able to start serving its purpose when one of the villagers came to visit a village that just so happened to live at 8 13.  come down so i want to talk to you guys i want to talk to you guys all right listen i've been hearing some bad things about you guys and i i did accuse you guys a little bit but you guys you're on an rp server you're on a village warfare server what are you doing how you've been on large for the entire like the entire night we've countered large like three times four times from what i've seen i've just seen minis going back and back back and forth and back and forth um but i did have a question for you guys so i did ask in your discord um we have the sulfur quarry unlock i don't know if we still do but do you want to work with us to wall that in and help you get guest codes on the gates and stuff and hopefully uh mutual agreement to use it to both be able to use it hmm what i don't know it's mutual what yeah you guys have lighthouse you know oh what does that mean we just want we just want to be able to use the silver quarry like if we need to is this an issue well i think what they're trying to say king harvest is uh that they don't want to have that mutual agreement i think what they're trying to do i understand i'm trying this is just just be blunt with it like you don't throw those just dance around the conclusion if you don't want us to take it you don't have to take it like you guys can come come over and you can try and use it what does that mean i'll take this out as you guys it's not not wanting to give them that so well i think this is pretty much settled hopefully i'll hear from you guys all right one way or another this was possibly my first failure as a king because i had just let that e13 group literally walk all over me but there was a reason for that you see their group didn't only have an intimidating base they also had the best players in the game zerg leaders builders fighters creators all with countless hours and experience in pvping and raiding and all one step ahead of everyone else on this server and me well i was role-playing as a king and that was the whole point of this server to talk to each other get allies have disagreements declare war but i'd soon realize that this hashtag clan wouldn't be interested in talking anymore all they want was war and it'd take more than an entire server to take them down foreign  so just in case an attack did come our way we decided to build a wall now this wasn't just any wall it was one that would secure our entire border and i decided to help the wall builders put down their initial foundation keeping them fully stocked with stone while they were doing so but that's when i realized that this border would take a little bit more time and resources than we expected so we just need to prioritize keeping the stone quarry under our control but while we were flying over to the quarry to restock the fuel that's one koala the person who was running it was killed oh no he died can you guys get to uh we're here right now okay bro the impossible cheater possible cheater i'm dead full dead okay they're one of the mini i don't know okay one of the uh  thing he's heavy plate bro i'm dead what the  we had lost about 150 000 stone worth of diesel and a handful of kits to the people who lived at pickle island which made us understandably pissed so we scouted out their island now they weren't a guaranteed target yet but then they started taunting us in chat this put us over an edge now we would definitely come back to raid them when we had the chance but we just need some time to prepare the boom so while we wait for the rockets to craft i was introduced to someone you might be familiar with and if you're not just listen to his voice very very closely who was here who is this who's here to come see me come have a meeting with me thunder most what's up do you have any others or is it just you just here all right so what would you like why are you here i'm here to serve globally and just help the cause i've been out farming all day for you i haven't even met you yet i want to prove myself to you we figured out that behind the turbo american accent is mimio a fellow russ youtuber who wasn't exactly supposed to be here so we decided to let him know that we knew it was him mr mr tundamos i'll just have to say your secret is safe with the kingdom you're free to do whatever you like your secret is safe with the king though your secret is safe for the king laughs damn it it's not that  hard to figure it out with this plan being a failure i let him be a part of our kingdom and become one of our villagers but later on i'd personally find out that that was a huge mistake anyway speaking about villagers we have pretty much neglected them up to this point so to show my appreciation i held a crowning ceremony through this ceremony the villagers that provided for the kingdom would be able to rise up through the ranks gaining access to our main base and ultimately becoming a lord of our kingdom which was named the draco dominion which is why all the villagers names start with draco and not something like villager but while i was waiting for the ceremony to begin something was different outside that today's sponsor this video is sponsored

enlisted for sponsoring the video regardless the ceremony had begun and honestly it was pretty slow hey you gold please step up to the throne since we were trying to be the largest kingdom in rust we had a lot of people to go through and having a lot of people leads to some parts of this meeting being chaos we have a promotion because i hear so many  gunshots get the  back in your seats sit the  back down would you like to be lady jade lady jade lady jade please stand down there the rest of you will meet the crowding ceremony was adjourned oh my  god the first crowning ceremony went about as well as youtube's pet and this was one of the first times that i realized being king wasn't as easy as i thought i mean the initial idea of controlling this server would be impossible if i couldn't even control my own people but the people still believed in my leadership and it was time to use some force on the server and raid pickle island all we needed was some sulfur to craft the rest of our gunpowder into explosives and luckily enough thunderbrose had a gift for me which might have provided us with just what we needed heard mr sundermost has a gift i'm bearing a gift for you this better be worth my time thundermans this better be worth my time because i i i've just abandoned some very important matters for this oh well  me it's a gift worthy for a king all right let's go see it let's go see it you should be able it is a large pro oh my god oh my gosh sir sir monty leaf since you are the least risky thing  indulge in my gifts hey i do hope you appreciated liking my beliefs oh this is incredible where did you what you said you wanted to be impressed wow look at this man all of you all of you look at this man you now address him as sir this man is a knight this man has earned my trust oh my god jesus now with more than enough sulfur i went over to pickle island to talk to their leader and give them one last chance to solve this without violence and it turned out their leader was a bit familiar i'm here to discuss the uh the ownership of the stone quarry uh give me one second let me uh let me go get the queen hello hello  um so i spoke spoke to vail and um she was a little busy it's just a little busy for me we can't just go in there and talk where she's in there i'm just like like i've seen the episode of um the walking dead before and like it always goes bad when you let other people inside your compound i mean uh do you think i have like snipers waiting or something yeah like like i got the gate open you i might die and they're like like genuinely i do not have anything set up right now to do like anything there's no other i would be sick but no no all right i like it i like it you're scaring me keep your eyes to the ground all right i'm just looking oh bro can i not look at your village all right all right guys to the god that's the god kill him paranoid why why what am i doing and there goes the chance of peace but lair had chosen this path and now we were going to war but before we go in there guns blazing we needed a solid plan and after looking at the village i came up with something we would fly in a scrappy and land here raid the southernmost buildings and take them over completely use each of them as a base of operations and raid the other buildings slowly moving up the ladder until he owned every base in their village with the plan set we headed out not at all ready for what was about to happen to us harvest can you give us a speech the grubs and i'll tell you lady valer or whatever the  you want to call her she is a grub she killed me when i tried to meet with her peacefully but now she's gonna feel our wrath it is time to take back our land take back to stone quarry take back everything that is rightfully ours is everybody with me is everybody with me okay  good job i'm  froze i'm literally froze okay okay blow the walls blow the wall throw the walls get in get in get in yeah confused i'm dead the raid was a complete failure valera and the people of pickle island were ready for us and shut us down instantly no bro landing boy how do they know this was my plan and it failed i had let not only my knights and lords but my whole kingdom down but this wasn't the end of the kingdom this was only the beginning the beginning of a new era one of prosperity and peace focusing on the stuff that really mattered so i stepped down from my throne went out into the world and for the rest of day one made it my goal to earn the respect of my people back the villagers nobles knights lords who built this kingdom from scratch and who made it possible for me to be king in the first place foreign    i  don't know what you're doing i don't know no i think you want to keep it that way but if you trust me with all my life mimio was acting a bit suspicious and i didn't really know what to do about it but i had to ignore it for now because one of our kingdom members needed help and that member was griff the grub he had made a base right outside of oil rig and it was getting raided by submarine so it was a race against the clock to get there before it was completely demolished what's on the rib  i'm gonna die come down here with melee quick oh no they broke it mini mini mini   i'm gonna die who's shooting oh god  in a matter of minutes we had lost the entire base the hours that griff and his tune spent grabbing aks kits even a few lines of rockets was all gone the worst part about it is that they were about to do a loot run to the main base but they had just lost it all to terrible timing and the person who was responsible for it all was named buttered cat now we had never interacted with him in the past but now that was another person on our list to get revenge so i decided that we needed to lighten the mood and hold our second crowning ceremony the event had been going on for more than a day at this point and there were a lot of people who deserved recognition for their hard work before the ceremony began i let anyone who had gifts present them to me just in case they might influence their promotion status he has a gift oh the skull of fancy orb stand in front of the crowd present whatever you have for me not once all of your enemies things and tanza the king of the north tanza's skull thank you sir most or mimio had given me three ot skulls now ot better known as the best clinton rust is notorious for being hard to kill so i didn't really know how he got these but once the ceremony began for all the sulfur c4 and rockets plp gave me he was promoted to noble and some nobles were promoted tonight and given access to the main base but for any night to be promoted to a lord there was a bit of a process you see we only had nine lords in the kingdom so for a night to be promoted a lord had to be demoed and now lords were supposed to be leaders in our kingdom taking the reigns when needed to without being told to do so and i had demoted two lords who are not worthy at that position and now there are two open spots to become a lord where a knight who was capable could become one instead one night who checked those bots as being sir ferguson who had spent the whole day leading and organizing the electricity in the main base and the throne and the last knight to be promoted to lord was not selected yet because i didn't really know who to choose so i let any knight who thought they were worthy tell me why i should promote them speak to me on why you should become lord let's start please please explain the reasons why he's become a lord uh cause i'd be gaming for real okay i'll be here gaming the villagers know me well i don't know peep the ribs boys peep there is not not a very not a very convincing reason but thank you sir throat it will be considered thank you sir thundermans please stand up onto the x and tell me why you should become a lord ever since i first arrived for your humble castle i've been in pure ore of your beauty at first question i present to do with a gift that i spent all day many days preparing not only that i went out on my own with no backup and took out three members of the ot clan who we  hate am i right boys yeah  the most convincing yet bro i believe you have been one up yeah  that guy through now as the king it was my decision on who became lord and i think the choice was pretty obvious sir and thundermost please stand in front of me so thunder most he provided me with three ot skulls the best presentation of three boxes of metal frad stone and sulfur that i have ever gotten through thunder most would you like to become a lord of the draco dominion thank you congratulations sir thomas actually lord thundermans congratulations hopefully you will lead like the lords who demoted congratulations after moving its way out the ranks mimio had become a lord and the kingdom was now at peace since we now had our wall fully set up and guarded we were safe from many threats so the villagers were able to roam around socialize trade do whatever they want and not have any worries whatsoever this truly felt like a new version of the kingdom and like i said before one of prosperity and peace but this piece would be short-lived because there was a group on this server who didn't want peace they wanted the complete opposite and they were coming directly to our kingdom to make sure of it  people on our wall it's brand new okay this is not optimal they're rating it they're rating it dessert that was here was unstoppable and taking over our wall one tc at a time the hours of work and thousands of resources were literally crumbling before our eyes and of course the people raiding our wall was the hashtag clan all we could do now is try our best to save it but since the villagers were not on team ui they wouldn't even let us get close to the action because they would kill us before we could even do so it was a waste of kits to try and save it because as i said before these guys were the best of the best so i went naked to try and talk to their leader to figure out what his deal was  is dust here i need i want to talk bro we're talking we're talking what's the plan bro what's the plan hey do i have voices on anarchy  our outer wall was completely gone dustin and his group had griefed the entire south section making it basically useless i felt terrible from the wall builders specifically lord killer claws who spent endless hours building the whole thing for the past two days and there was nothing we could do they were too strong had too many numbers and we just ended up fighting our own people anyway but what else would we let them take our villagers bases our base we had to draw the line somewhere and there was only one way that they listened to us because dust only wanted one thing and that was anarchy so i would bring him anarchy you see this hashtag clan has been terrorizing not only us but the entire server and they weren't here to play into village warfare they were here to compete because they never even made a village and weren't interested in diplomacy anymore so i went to every group every kingdom every leader and asked them the same question i wanna form a united nations with everybody on the server and take e13 down and spend as many rockets as we can to foundation wipe their base are you willing to uh join something like that 100 countless in so i can't say no to that we would need to talk to pickle island yet some rain birds in green had agreed but moy dollar and the rest of the groups on the server preferred to meet and discuss it as one big group which included pickle island the same people we tried to raid before but the hashtag clan was a bigger threat to all of us so we put our differences aside and agreed to meet so i know we have we've had some issues throughout this event throughout this server i know we've had some issues between us i want to put that beside us i want us all to join together in raid e13 send enough rockets so we can see the other side and bring that entire base to the floor because they do not deserve a spot on this server so does anyone else have anything to say on that does everyone agree hell yeah harvest do you agree  i agree low neck agrees yeah jennifer do you agree abby do you agree yep valer i'm sorry that i tried to write you do you agree rain birds do you publicly agree yeah yes all right and valer i'll give you a second so this will be the united nations um i i'm four on the discord i'm inviting all of you to it you can join valer we just need a decision from you though all right well  okay okay out ways uh one my vote doesn't even matter so it's fine oh okay so when do we want to do this do we want to do this tonight yeah time time do you want to do this tonight as in in the next like two to three hours yeah in the next two hours and surprisingly that's all it took i now had the support of basically every single group on the server to raid the hashtag clan so we all agreed to take some time to prepare but i have been gone for my kingdom for a while preparing for this race and in that time my kingdom had turned to chaos you see this server had accelerated decay so the wall was already crumbling letting anyone who wanted to get into our kingdom an easy entrance and the reason why we weren't guarding it is because the hashtag land took a long time to leave fighting us and our villagers impaired with the ghosters and the other teams who just wanted to grab us it was anarchy just like dust had wanted on top of all this there was one villager named snow who was fed up with the whole situation of being caught in the crossfire so he started killing us and fighting back before this turned into rating our own people i tried my best to de-escalate the situation and understand where he was coming from snow snow come come outside come outside come outside oh you know what actually i will i got three beds in here i'm down hold up at some point people have a breaking point and that  hits quick what's up man no do you know what e13 you know what you're 13. i know who e13 is dog i know who they are i've been talking to them for a little bit now because they not they're not as discriminative as y'all snow is talking about the hashtag clan and while this would basically give us the right to kill him i decided to give him a chance and hear what he had to say but i'm tired of getting killed by my own teammates that no it's me i've seen three of your guards killed me how you doing how you do it i said you go to the lord then they will tell me they don't do  dude my homie shadow he not really my homie because i don't live with him but he went to law enforcement and reported a crime and they shot him for no reason he farmed y'all so many boxes of stone and y'all shot him dude there's so many cases out here that y'all aren't paying attention to there's so many people that are just trying to help and y'all shoot them this was a new perspective that i haven't heard before because i've been stuck in my throne room for the majority of the event and haven't taken the time to listen to the needs and wants of my people but for snow there was nothing i could really do the dude was just too fed up and he just needed some time to cool down and there was just too much in motion with the hashtag clan so we just made sure our kingdom was safe for now and joined the united nations discord and started to plan out the raid but this discord wasn't as secure as we thought someone who wasn't supposed to was listening to our conversation hearing every single thing that we were saying you see we had a good amount of streamers a part of this race and as confirmed by the event host himself the hashtag clan took it upon themselves to watch their stream when they were not supposed to which is called stream sniping and without knowing that we continued to plan out the raid and settled for a more chaotic strategy you see we could raid from multiple sides or two opposite sides but we decided to raid from just one to do the maximum amount of damage that we could do to their base but we would split up into two groups and raid from two different raid bases both groups would have a leader and group one was led by valer the queen of pickle island group 2 was led by me both of us would micromanage to raid and make any decisions when necessary one of those decisions was to put a ton of sleeping bags down before the raid started so he'd be able to respawn and thanks to lord conor at an empire's weed farm that they had in our kingdom we had tons of clothes so we grabbed as much as we could and started handing it out to our group now prepared with tons of respawn points it was time to bring the boom and actually start this race so we brought everyone to our kingdom and i had one last thing that i had to do in less than an hour we will be launching one of the largest raids in russ history we have put aside our petty differences to seek one common goal to annihilate the hashtag clan they have held their spot on their server for far too long we have the numbers we have the rockets we have the drive to succeed and blow their base to pieces failure is not an option are you with me are you  with me thank you  dust had agreed to wait to shoot at us until he heard a boom so we put a raid bases down and waited until i said it was time to go start walking sorry sorry let's go let's go time can never be you trusted a friend or yours  hey  you all people on my team in my kingdom take over the left tower push left push left one i'm raiding the tower i'm riding the tower until uh come in here come break the break the bags break the bags   thank you anarchy   i'm dead i'm dead i just got rocketed  their own mission from the rights first first killed me who's killing me bro the raid wasn't going exactly to blend we were making good progress on opening their base but since we weren't on the same team ui our own teammates were killing us more than the hashtag clan was and the only thing holding us back from entering their base was the sheer amount of turrets that they had and with the night soon approaching would give them the chance to seal up the race so all we had to do was send the rest of the rockets we had before it was completely lost opening breach opening breach opening breach opening breach  breach is open breaches open on right here the night had come and they had almost sealed up the raid and we were out of rockets and told thundermos found something that would give us our last chance to actually win this i have a lot of rockets right under most rides run rocket egg i'm one hp it's not the most you're gonna have to do here not to do it here perfect we're in court core is fully open this is the rts game on setting the army in come on double click on the base double click on the base run in  fancy uh i don't know how much longer you want me to last on the server fancy but i'm losing people every day after that harvest uh what do you look what do you do after that man i'm naked on my i don't even have my throne i don't even have my throat i gathered everything started recording today you're the most badass king on this server you had a whole throne room of lords and knights and villagers by her side but now you were left with nothing oh who's this it's okay for the loyal soldier who's still here who is this come here just do this man right here fancy he is one of the few people who are loyal to you harvest now let me narrate your story for a second he grew a massive kingdom he had hundreds over a hundred people it was a community there's laughter there was joy but because you ran into the wrong people and you picked the wrong fights you lost a massive raid you try to gather an entire serving with his embarrassing loss and now oh my god people have given up on you what will the king do after his kingdom has fallen and all his people have abandoned but there's still few loyal soldiers still around it's up to you how your story hands harvest does it end here or do you continue hoping how many hours we're 48 hours into this event 48 hours there's 96 in total we're halfway done so you you can tell this to dust you can tell us to his entire group we'll be back we'll be back as long as the nodes are still there as long as there's still people in my kingdom i'm gonna keep sending rockets until i see the other  side of their base fancy orb  when i got on in the morning most of my team was offline and it's not like i was on early people were just demotivated because we had lost the raid and the villagers had been causing us just too many issues from ghosting to complaining to just being straight up nuisances it weighed on all the knights and lords and just made it not fun to play in this event anymore so as the king i had to change something it was up to me to decide on how to move on from this and get my people back so i went in my throne room and made a decision that would change the entire course of this event from my kingdom  the streets are empty there's no laughter they have all left you harvest you can't call yourself a king right now no one looks at you like a king anymore foreign   foreign  it was a massacre we raided and slaughtered every single villager in our kingdom all to just bring our core team back together again was this too far was there a reality where we could have lived with our villagers peacefully but to be at our strongest and to actually be able to defend our base during any future raids on us we thought that this was the only way forward and after almost all the villagers bases were rated fancy said that he liked to come meet with us this is how democracy ends huh no this is how democracy begins this is how democracy begins fancy you can see we're all equal now we're all in one group we just got finished reading about 10 different villagers they're all gone they're all off the island we're one solid rust group now fancy so instead of being a leader you go around and raid all the people that were there on day one to support and build a community you just throw them away like they're pieces of garbage harvest i allowed them to leave i gave them a grace period they were allowed to leave the the island we didn't shoot at them we didn't kill them and anyone who wanted to leave left and anyone who wanted to stay they had been raided all those people took hours of their day to support you and build that wall but and this is how you treat them back you just you just kick them out like it's nothing e13 took that wall from us and to get the wall back we need to stop the ghosting problem we need to all get in one team ui and all act as a group a collective group so to do so we need to get the villagers out  the wall because it's griefed anyway e13 griefed it and we're just focusing on restoring our trust in each other and feeling like we're all on the same level as you can see killer you ever hear what it was just the three of us after that speech i gave and this and you you support this to your killer well fancy i kind of built that whole wall by myself with the help of uh lawn chair and black flag so yeah um i do we bought that water protect the villagers and they turned on us sometimes sometimes question what you do here but i i just don't even know what to say man i i'm really speechless after fancy left i had another visitor and it just so happened to be one of the villagers who we slaughtered and he wanted to talk what do you want the declaration of independence from villages of draco and corn berserkers act one villagers will no longer identify way to draco or any of its inhabitants second point the corn berserkers hereby declare war on your kingdom gasp the corn berserkers are hereby stating that by the end of the 24 hour mark your skull will be mounted on our new base congrats you're gonna kill me once while i'm naked outside congrats will you take over my base shadow do you have enough rockets to take over my base do you have enough people to kill all of us look at us if we have aks what do you have shadow tell me what exactly do you have enough yeah you have enough yeah yeah yeah you're so strong you're so tired we threw you out you're not you're not declaring your dependence you're thrown to the streets shadow i don't need  from you take down our base shadow try take your face down do it unlike others you can't win shadow tried to intimidate us and ultimately fail and after we dealt with him i noticed that the throne room was missing something you see our group dynamic had changed significantly after killing the villagers there was no power structure anymore we were all just playing rust as a solid group and to represent that everyone deserved their own place in this room everyone deserved their own throne and you'd think with no more villagers surrounding our base we'd at least have a mode of silence let's silence usually comes before the storm what the  they're building a ray base right now north side right now oh god i'm bringing hvs i'm bringing around okay i'm bringing rockets let's just go instantly boom it's time boy that's a raid base oh my god killer you are wrong it's navy it's a navy they rated grip okay okay okay i'm pushing down i'm pushing up pushing out flank around left frank i'm flanking around left someone come with me please please dude they chose a terrible time it's turning back got her cat that's navy that's a navy pushing i'm pushing i'm still pushing there pushing that pushing left and uh wow there's three of them pushing it three in the pushing out the channel now the navy chose pretty much the worst time to raid us because the knight gave us an opportunity to take control of the race all we had to do now was try and control their raid base and a neighboring group led by my friend sigbog would help us try and do just that i told him i told them they're not gonna shoot you right this right base right now they're rating rating grade base and right side the writing grading there's rocketing we're going we're going into very base right now we're jumping in we're jumping in he's down there it's down there they're all down there great race we have rebase okay we're good we're good we're good we're good we're good we're good oh my god let's go boys this was our first one of the event which called for a bit of a celebration in the throne room so but the odd stats against us with the raid base bill and the rockets being sent into our core we held down the hatches we all defended the raid and we all successfully defended against the navy we avenged griffed the grub we avenged the water base we avenge the oil base now this does not stop here we have much bigger targets on our hands we have much bigger things to do e13 we tried to raid them it failed ruining club for now we need to get back at them we are going to farm rockets until we have enough to see the other side of e13 space we are gonna farm rockets until we blow all of their foundation sound e13 there's going to be an ashes by the time the server ends  but i didn't really know how we do that because we had already brought the whole server to their doorstep and that's when i got a message on discord that would change everything and it did change everything you see we had been farming preparing hyping ourselves up all day for the second attempt on the hashtag land but now they were coming to us the clan that griefed my wall stole any semblance of peace for me and forced me to destroy my own kingdom was coming to take me out now i can say that i wouldn't let this happen but most of them literally pvp for a living they'd win the raid easily leaving me with one choice i could let the raid play out normally go out honorably while losing it all or finish what i started and play it dirty like they did by stream sniping and in that moment after all the torture all the anguish all the terrible things that this one clan had made me do to my own people i chose dishonor  foreign oh my  god you're not attacked do not attack do not  attack they're building right there okay okay let them build let them build wait wait until the first rocket the hashtag planet came prepared with the fortified raid base and it seemed like they were ready to take us out so we had a few cards up our sleeves first being tiga tom the best tea farmer in russ who supplies us with matt's health tease giving us each plus 20 help meaning killing us would take an etra hit and we did have a more dishonorable strategy that would take effect later in the race but for now we were holding fire and waiting for the hashtag clan to boom so this raid can actually begin go go oh my oh i'm through fps where's the priest they appreach they breached  okay i'm calling him   okay it's sealed it's semi-sealed semi-seal for now the hashtag clan wasn't making too much progress on the wall the lag had gotten unbearable at this point so i had to re-log and when i logged back in the situation had gotten a whole lot worse foreign this is gonna turn bad real fast the hashtag clan and not only rated our china wall they were taking it over and soon enough they'd be able to use it to its full advantage check out that one oh jesus  christ  now they were taking control of the raid itself our only chance to push him back was to get them out of the wall  who has it the one no  the hashtag clan had cleared us out of the wall and was getting too much traction in this race so it was time to bring out the strategies that we decided to use in retaliation for them stream sniping us and that strategy is called the king's gambit you see in chess a gambit is when you risk a piece to gain a calculated advantage and in this situation i was risking my kingdom to finish what i started by coming over the raid me the hashtag clan had left something unguard and that was their main base so before the raid started i coordinated with rainbirds a close and fed up neighbor to the hashtag clan to begin raiding them when i told him to do so pulling the hashtag clan back to their main base and ultimately giving us an opportunity to seal up our base and so with half of our china wall controlled by the hashtag clan already i told rainbirds to start but he wasn't answering and with the raid ramping up we just had to try and survive oh my god holy   rainbirds please oh  the course opening oh god oh god oh  oh  oh my god  foreign close the doors close the doors i'm gonna start booming oh my god that's on the way down oh my god it's all open oh my god  the hashtag clan had not taken the bait they committed to the raid and let their base get fully rated which is the worst case scenario because now we were up against not only the best players in rust but the best players in rust while they're angry so without any scummy strategies left to use we'd have to win this for real no it's not no it's  not es i have the tuna the tuna is still okay yeah yeah let's get pulling nuts okay building mats try to steal try to steal  i can seal i'm ceiling foreign  had the tc on the side that they were raiding and none of us could seal up the base and for us to win this we need to place these walls because the only thing separating the hashtag clan from our base was the turrets and with this big of a hole the turrets would only be on for so much longer before the batteries were destroyed i got one i got one i got one oh my god okay okay  church are off in the on the core turrets are off now without any working outside turrets they were able to push into the raid and that just made it a whole lot more difficult for us to keep them out think about that kill them  sorry come come this body right here would have the ability to change the course of the race four aks and tons of emma will give us four kits to use after i stash them inside the base all right bakers cinema i vacation ammo i'm dropping aks in the northwest um of the base they're all on the ground oh what oh my  god okay i think i closed them in you ready ready oh my god there's so many in there yeah they're both dead i killed both of them so many kids so many cats i'm in here well the coast was clear for now i went outside to get as many outer tc's as i could to hopefully seal up the base so your ceiling compound right now ceiling  i just don't have a crib now while i didn't have privilege outside i now had privilege inside and could seal up the rain rainbow s okay as i continue sealing the amount of hashtag clan members still trying to come back were dwindling and after only a few more minutes there was only one person left rewind let's go oh we got a w we were victorious we had somehow survived our base being torn open by the best players on the server and on top of that we finally finished what we started the hashtag clan's base was fully cored and they were not coming back on the server anytime soon now you could call this a roman but again their group was purposely strange typing other content creators during the raid on them they deserved exactly what was coming for them so after you defeat your main enemy on the server it calls for a bit of a celebration and that's exactly what we did in the throne oh my god oh my god there's so many of you okay everybody's here uh lord thundermans is going to give us a speech he's going to give us a speech and i will talk to all of you for all of you afterwards lords knights even some villagers if you're here still not only did you fight bravely for your lovely king harvest we managed to defeat our biggest enemy on the server here here  down i would like to personally thank king harvest not only has it shown me how to be such a great king it has also shown me what not to do as a king bro king harvest i have watched over you for quite some time now and i don't believe you are fit to be any sort of king we're thunderbirds  when i have a plot twist for all of you what is this it's actually me mimio  assistant  mimio was a mastermind all this time he had been contributing to the kingdom he had been planning to overthrow me all along and i kind of deserved it but for a plan this genius i was happy to hand the title of king over to mimio this man this man is your  king look at him if you uh if you tagged the letters ton the most and rearrange it it literally spells do not trust me after that whole situation there was really nothing else to be done our greatest enemy was defeated i wasn't even king anymore and this server was now at peace and you see i said at the beginning that this was an event server and the server itself was coming to a close and the event that would end the server was water rising now even though i didn't have a kingdom anymore i thought that this would be a good time to reminisce and take a good look at what my kingdom once was for one last time  balloon  i used to roll the dice  us making us dead along with the king one minute     ain't nothing  no she's worth but that was when i ruled the world  foreign  thank you so much for watching this video took hundreds of

tU_UNiiFEIY,I Was Trapped on an Island with 100 Rust Players,427172,7957,279,0 days 00:35:19,this is me a part of the last 10 players competing to win this entire island and this is also me about to be killed by the person i trusted most but how did i get here well i was a part of fancyorb's last to leave the island event where each person has only one life and the last person standing wins the entire server and my goal was not to win here's why in the last event i was trusted by a kid named baz and i manipulated that trust to take advantage of him and ultimately kill him i ended up dying too but i still had to redeem myself so the goal for this time around was to keep baz safe and bring him all the way to the end giving him what i took away from him last time a chance to win this entire island and i had a plan starting with a casino now there was something different about this casino something that made it a little bit deadly hola hola hola all right you guys okay let's go f4 top right f4 top right with the event starting we decided to build right here next to the only monument on the map hopefully leading to lots of traffic but before we could build our casino there was a mandatory meeting all right everyone pay attention up here i am speaking i'm speaking now listen there is currently 100 of you on this server right now but only one can win this island all right some of you will play dirty some of you will play nice but at the end of the day do whatever it takes to be the last person standing you guys have 45 minutes until the pvp stage has started all right in this first pvp stage 15 players will die so go ahead and start farming get ready 45 minutes 45 minutes while it seems like a lot of time if we don't have our base built by the end of this we're probably gonna die so we started farming for our base  after we got enough wood i farmed a lot of nodes and i mean a lot of nodes speaking about farming nodes every single sub and follow i got on all these platforms by the end of the year equals one sulfur node farm for a future video so change the title of that video by subscribing or following on any of these platforms the links are in the description and thank you so much to anyone that does getting back to farming nodes if you're paying attention you might have noticed something baz had been disconnected he was allowed to log back in but this would be the beginning of an entire event of connection issues how is he supposed to be the last to leave the island if he can't even play the event but luckily enough he managed to get back on and while he still had over a thousand ping we started to head to the build spot but we got interrupted yes yes yes yes yes yes harvest i'm not a rat this time this time i'm not wrong my redemption arc okay my redemption arc baz didn't deserve what happened last time and i was going to make it right but with this connection still being an issue i built the base and committed to do whatever it takes to get this poor kid to the end there was a duo outside of her base predicting baz was gonna die but before i deal with him let me tell you about war thunder war thunder is the most comprehensive vehicle combat game ever made you can play with more than 2 000 tanks planes helicopters and ships in dynamic combined arms pvp battles every single vehicle is incredibly detailed and

link on page see there's a large free bonus pack including multiple premium vehicles premium account boosters and much more and thank you war thunder for sponsoring this video so i dealt with it pretty reasonably no baz okay we don't open that door there was now somebody stuck in our base but because of something fancy mentioned before the last meeting it would probably be all right if you're not at the meeting area you will be killed i'm not kidding like we will kill you all right if we did it last time we will do it again these are mandatory when i say mandatory they are they are mandatory so we just leave them in there and force fancy to kill him just as long as baz was okay with it and it seemed like he was come on listen you know what i said don't listen to him just don't listen i wonder how you were dead yeah yes let's keep going farming with our newly found roommate situated i went to go visit someone you might be familiar with rollo bralo someone featured in the majority of my videos and who's usually an admin for fancy over events was now stuck in prison i didn't know why it was in there and without a plan to get him out i just had the hope that he had something in mind so i just headed back to base and started working on converting our base into something like the casino from before but that wasn't without issue because baz was pretty much unable to help me farm resources and without enough materials to build the base and the first pvp stage coming in 20 minutes the casino had to be a little bit smaller than i intended but it would still be able to kill people trapping them in here before a mandatory meeting and forcing fancy to come kill just like we did to travis speaking about travis we should probably check on him yeah it's a casino i just need to go farm right now i need to go farm for the uh materials what's up confusion you gonna visit my casino i mean i'm kind of bored you know i've already won this or like you know i don't really yeah yeah and also uh we do have a we do have travis in our airlock right there oh we know he's did he log off oh no he logged off oh no wait really wait oh is there furniture oh look look uh oh no we had indirectly eliminated travis i wasn't even sure that he was gray's duo partner in the first place and i still trapped him inside our base but less people on the island gives baz a better chance and as i said i had committed to do whatever it takes to get this poor kid to the end let's just go up here okay okay okay i'm sorry i'm sorry you guys you guys are chatting out already what the hell your guns and everything bro i have a bow you know okay buzz i can't  yeah i mean you are playing you got this buzz it's okay i'm keeping you safe i'm keeping you safe all right are you in here oh my god the best there's a clown here for you although playing through the lag wouldn't be as fun for him i still had to try my best to uphold my promise and give him a chance to win but after seeing how good up falcon and como were i'd need all the help we can get and that's when i got a discord message and it was confusion and he wanted a favor he couldn't do it himself because the admins were watching him but he told me the location of a stash and the plan was to break bralow out of prison now i said that i needed help protecting baz but i didn't need it bad enough to risk my own life but i did tell brawl that i'd be back so i went to look for the stash but ended up getting a little sidetracked  no no no no no get up  uh baz we have another person trapped in our base i've pushed yeah i'm gonna do some stuff from you all right before i let you out no i'll give you stuff i'll give you stuff i'll give you some stuff make it worth my while to let you out what's up what's up i uh i can't use that door right now i'm scrapped some people in there what i got food  experience the world he can't be stuck with the same one forever yes yes yes yes we're gonna make an experience all the toilets in the world porgy okay so what porgy reminded me that i still need to help bralo i let the guy out of our base because there wasn't a mandatory meeting for a while and i went to the spot that confusion said and there was 2c4 and a red card i don't know what that combination of items would do for me but i just had to wait for another message from confusion but by the time i got back to base things were different baz was offline and this wasn't like the last time now he wasn't responding to any of my messages and while waiting for him the first pvp stage began people started rating fighting letting out all the anger they had bottled up for the past hour and with some threats already directed at baz i prepared for the worst ready defend him from anything that would come our way reality started to set in it had already been 10 minutes and baz still wasn't online and with them still not responding to any messages i sent i started to get ready to run this casino alone our best best you're back no oh you were gone guys okay no he's alive i thought he was dead he was asleep oh my god legends never die while i was happy baz wasn't gone something shook the island during this pvp stage and i think fancy's reaction in discord will tell you exactly how everyone felt oh my god tanza already died holy  another ot member has died holy  ot the best clan and rust had lost two members meaning that people might be less afraid to come outside their base that's pvp phase and raid each other regardless the pvp phase was now over and you can see by this counter in the top left that we lost 16 people compared to the star and with the competition getting a bit more fierce i think it's time we get a net your teammate so i checked discord and confusion had sent directions on where to go and what to do how did you get to c4 foreign  see you later nerd i'm making a nice use of this space but that's okay you've been there for a long time i think that's what you think db that's what you think rob other people for other people here are we safe okay come on come on let's go go go go go go go go go go i heard it all i heard it here we have a crossbow defend yourself go come on come on come on come on okay we'll be quiet be quiet all right  you've been doing bad safe come on let's go let's go let's go let's be quiet be quiet shut up where'd brolo go wait rollo is on the loose guys shut the  up shut the  up you don't know where he is we do not know who blew him out all right we're home we're home we're home yes okay okay here join the team join the team we have bralo okay okay we now had the most wanted man on the server hiding in our base and while we were waiting for the island to cool down i told him that all this was confusion's plan and afterwards i asked him why confusion would set all this up and he said to look at this section of the last island video uh fancy there's some there's some dodgy dealings going i need to get into a private call you real quick let me share my screen he's given confusion stuff the brothers helping confusion even though bros so it was glooming owner of gloomin's goods who snitched on brawlow and confusion in the last event which now tells us why brala was in prison and why confusion wanted to help brala but that leaves one more thing gloom in the snitch we had a plan to deal with him but first we needed to deal with brala and confusion had something in mind we'd somehow get bralow apart and to do that confusion would have to win the island-wide election at the nets mandatory meeting but that was in 40 minutes in the meantime i actually tried to run my casino hopefully getting some trust from the other contest distance in the process and i didn't realize it at the time but this would be much harder than i thought people trusted it at first but as time went on they got more and more skeptical does anyone want to gamble okay bro bro i like this there's windows there's windows people have rockets no corgi come on no no porky come on who's there come gamble come gamble jj come come it's not a trap face come on bro jj you can't say try to trap me jj shut the  up bro i i didn't i didn't try to trap you at all i didn't try to trap anybody the casino felt like a lost cause even after taking the door off people still didn't trust it and before i knew it the second pvp stage began but without anything to do and baz safe and bralo hidden i just waited for the nets mandatory meeting all right everyone can i gather your attention at the meeting area please this is important now there has been a lot of killing on this server and we need a leader of the island how we're gonna do this is whoever has the most votes in the chat is going to be a representative we're gonna have two people come up and give their speeches on why they should be leader of the island so go ahead and type a name in the chat on who you would like to be the leader there's a lot of confusion confusion all right confusion is one of the leaders he will give a speech we need a second person who is the second person you'd like to go orgy oh i see porgy we can do confusion and porgy let me get you guys on the stage all right borgy go up to the stand would you like to run for leadership on this island i would love to run for leadership on this island and i might say there are plenty of changes that are gonna happen they're gonna be beautiful so tell us please tell the people we're gonna make this island a great place there's been chilling but there's been no organization it's all been paid and suffering and you know what's gonna fix that mustaches i'm i'm just i'm just gonna craft a lot a lot a lot of mustaches i don't want any mustaches pretty much that that's not going on i didn't take this through i didn't take this through none of this is planned mustache just that's it that's all i didn't think this through i wasn't supposed to be up here after porgy's amazing speech it was now up to confusion to win this election and grant brawlow a pardon division please take the stage and do the same and tell the people why we should vote for you as the new leader of the island go ahead ladies and gentlemen i i come to you today i i'm a presidential attire i'm fit to be a leader let me tell you my stances my first stance no elimination challenges for the good of the people nobody will be eliminated we're all gonna make it through secondly i want to get the economy running by running some shops i think giving giving gear to the people is what we must do that is that is my stance so i want to make changes for the good of the people i know i messed up the last island video but i want to make it right the people loved it confusions changes would actually provide them value unlike porky's mustaches but it was time to see if the majority of people loved it please walk to the side of the stadium who you'd like to vote for so if you'd like to vote for confusion go to the k side if you would like to go for 4g then okay we have a lot more for confusion confusion as the new leader of the islands thank you thank you thank you okay all right everyone you made this purse everyone may go away can i can i can i say something yes go ahead wait wait he has one more he has one more thing one more i was talking about renovations right what about gloom and shop i i think i i think i have somebody here um bralo bralo you are you here hello here yeah i'm i'm here oh no we're all low come on up here still alive how the  i'm right here go ahead i don't know what this is about i actually have no idea what you're gonna say what is that i think that glooming shop could uh use a new owner and i think uh i think my man bralo here is perfect for the job he didn't do anything wrong guys wait wait do you guys see how in prison do you guys see this guys the two people who cheat in the last video i think this is us this is us i think that brolo should sell rockets and aks for a discounted price and you know what i i also think i think that elimination rounds should be 2x can we why don't we pick this up huh you can't you can't trust come on guys you like the mean you guys are you guys are stupid you guys are already elected him it's already it's already in motion guys all right everyone may leave everyone may leave confusion oh my god you guys messed up guys what are you guys doing confusion now had control of the island not only that but he could now enact revenge on gluman for snitching on him in the last event but without dedicated law enforcement in place on the island glooman wouldn't leave the shop on his own so we'd have to take it by force but first we'd at least give him the opportunity to leave but that went about as well as you at its best yeah glorman you're not the you're not the owner of this anymore there are no terms glooming this isn't yours anymore all right blooming this isn't your shop anymore you heard confusion i'm the rightful owner of this place and you stole my business from me yeah i don't i don't i don't think this will be a business if you take over because 90 of the island dwellers are loyal to me this doesn't look like 90 glooming i'm not gonna lie look at this business you're just another pawn in this island i'm coming for this no matter what this is gonna be my shop well i'll be waiting for that yes okay bro i think we gotta go as i said it went exactly how you think it'd go so we devised a plan one that would rely on a very specific aspect of the building the elevator shaft you see when i was leaving i took a look at the broken elevator and it looked like the perfect place to hide so the plan is to walk into the shop act like we're customers and hide in the elevator shaft until the pvp stage began then the shop would go in lockdown as they usually do during the pvp stage and they would be locked inside with us while inside we'd say gluman in any guards he has hostage and from then on their fates would be up to brawlow and confusion because this was their revenge to seek not mine all we had to do now is get into the shaft without anyone noticing all right boys close the door close the door what's this i hear about not wanting to god i don't think i wanna get a place by a corruption my bad i didn't realize listen i got steering right here shut up shut up man stay there stay there do not  move don't you dare come near me don't come near me give me the jackhammer come on the ground get out of the shop no no no no no no no we could either use them we need to use them my bad my bad my bad my bad now we can get we get we get a price for two do we want do we want to use both of these dude do we need two you want to know what i think of of you sting you want to know  i'm not subscribing you little  oh my god donuts please don't do anything i'll do anything now that we were in control of a hostage we can now persuade fancy to give us whatever we want so we started talking about ideas i think i think we proposed some uh terms to fancy what do we need i don't really need much i just need people eliminated that's it okay no the harvest the harvest i have to i have to pay you back for like housing me what i have a casino that no one goes inside all i want all i want is to be safe that's all i want genuinely i just want him to go to the end i don't what i don't know what we'll guarantee him to get to the end but why don't we run with that we need something anything anything along those we need oh get bad's like a pass for an elimination round like give him like one pass if he gets out okay give bears  uh oh that's your life oh you think that trade a life for a life yes yes you know that's perfect i like that so it was official we try to negotiate a life for a life trading steen for an extra life for baz speaking about baz i made sure to give him a call just in case this goes south hello hello what's up how's it going pass fast we have a kind of hostage situation happening right now ignore it all right after this i'll be back for you all right i might i might be able to negotiate you getting another life we'll see we'll see okay i might i yeah yeah yeah we'll trade steen for you we'll trade a life for a life we'll see i'll try my best okay okay okay okay i'll see you soon now that we had baza's blessing it was finally time to call fancy over we killed them i'm outside what's going on what's going on where's the woman well actually um upstairs yeah so you know steam steen's alive right that's a life i want to trade a life for a life fancy yeah all right i want you to give baz an extra life if we give you steen it's a life or a life fancy if you don't we're just i'm just gonna trap him in here and kill him next time come to the window all right you know steve he's a very good friend of mine and uh i don't think that we can trade a life for a life is anything else at all that you that uh that you would request to let steen out for being hostage if he if if he's a really good friend of yours you you trade a life or a life db if you don't he's not gonna get let out he's just gonna be stuck in here until they're next to do this we can't do that harvest we can't no one can get two lives what i'm gonna say is if you can't give bears an extra life maybe you can give him protection something to make sure he won't die and he can have more odds to get to the end all right but what i can do is bez can be in the stands during this elimination challenge and he won't have to go through it is that okay so that means next 20 he get he guarantees top ten that's pretty good odds i'm not gonna lie i think we need a little bit more though i think you go to baz and then you give him whatever you want an exit okay okay i don't care fine fine fine fine didn't get a natural life having a guaranteed spot in the top 10 is more than enough but now it was time for that elimination round hello everyone congratulations you guys have made it to final 30. well let me get my baseball bat here so we're gonna play a game of tag so we're gonna kill 18 people until there's the top ten so look around 18 of you will be dying you might be thinking you can just run for me well i'll be using spanish at some points and going invisible it'll be announced when i go invisible but i will only have five seconds of invisibility but i can use that to catch up to you guys because you won't know where i am but i will always know where you are while this challenge was not what we expected all i knew is that i had to survive to protect bass at first i was afraid i was petrified thinking i could live without you by my side and after spending nights thinking how you did me wrong i grew strong and i learned    he's in the house   you

the rest of this event pvp will be enabled now there's another rule that we must follow there's no more going back to your bases you cannot enter a base everything you must do must be outside all teaming is allowed uh but we're gonna go until there's a final three with that being said seven of you will die you guys have five minutes so go ahead since teaming was allowed we were in a group of five but as fancy said only three would be in the final elimination round so it was time to fight for our lives there's both of them in like 10 seconds all right in 13 seconds guys 14 seconds no no he's gonna get around the side okay okay we gotta back up there's guy there's a guy above us there's a guy above us we gotta just back up seven people need to die god dude it's so ratty over here we go people with trees or something as koala said there was an ot member who was still alive and he was trying to tempt us in the chat whoever is in the five group you know this you can kill all members in secure your spot just saying yeah it's past i don't see your name tag that is true don't listen to him don't listen we're not gonna do that with the ot member unsuccessful fancy decided to give baz

hPJoVA8Mzj0,This Quarry Exploit Gave Us Unlimited Scrap,329238,7210,329,0 days 00:17:11,high quality metal one of the most important resources in rust required to upgrade your base armor and even weapons and somehow we managed to get an infinite amount of the stuff this was because we abused a very specific aspect of the ichigram core which first required us to control and this is where we encountered our first issue it was already taken okay let me see oh i didn't do that that wasn't me that wasn't me i didn't just do that someone had left over 1 000 high quality metal in the quarry which is a good sign that the exploit still works but before i explain how it works we have to talk about something i'm not the first person to use this at split in sir winter's video he says this credit to harvest who briefly mentioned the theory of just the throne now i found the x-play i told it to throat saying i'll record something on it later but to let me know if he's planning on posting anything so i can have time to record my own wipe on it so throat was planning on recording the exploit with sir winter but midwipe sir winter decided to post it on twitter alerting the devs and server owners about this meaning that we were playing with a ticking time bomb that can get banned at any moment and i'm not hating on winter for doing so but come on man but let me explain how this exploit works first you have to have access to the hqm quarry and outpost then you need to farm 150 scrap and buy 300 low grade with it and by diesel fuel then you run the htm quarry with that diesel and smelt the h gram or sell the cooked h grama outpost and repeat the process if you notice each time you run one diesel you profit 50 scraps so in theory you can get infinite high qual and scrap and with both of those resources you can get anything in the game that you'd want the only problem is that you have to be on a 2x and as far as i know this x-plate still works on a few 2x's but now it was time to start working on the game plan first we needed to secure the quarry and since some previous owner already did that we just needed to secure the place where i jumped in before so to do so we just build our base there but we need to farm for the materials first since we now had enough materials we built our base and started smelting the hqm from before in a decayed compound in preparation for the second goal of our gameplay plan buying a mini copter transporting everything from the quarry to outpost would take a lot of time so a mini would just speed up the process and also we found some turrets with pythons in them in the decayed compound so these would come in handy later but for now since there is no bandit on this map we started to head to outpost to go buy some scrap and then a mini but it did not go to plan on top of on top of a supermarket he's locking out he's like yeah ready ready oh  for sure put another guy the tommy after bralo finished uploading at supermarket oh here's another tommy he gave me a tommy and we kept going but then we got sidetracked again people help people they have a mini oh what wait wait wait wait wait wait he's about to take off i think ready three two one watch on oh it's down i think okay okay there's another one there's one more there's one more i'm stashing the high court right here started lagging so bad daddy said he said i'm done though i'm done but he's dead one okay there's only two calling me  you need to crawl i'm getting i am crawling to this rocker here just come get me with our newly acquired mini we flew back to base and if you notice we have a good amount of teammates and these teammates were all focused on baiting the turrets in the decayed compound next door and that made a lot of noise and was probably the cause of what's about to happen next but for now we grab the stashed high call and started to head to outpost to buy some scrap but first let me tell you about manscaped this man right here is my buddy grant and he's recently had some problems with the ladies hey ladies   sopher's birthday i gave him a manscaped beard edger the beard hedger uses skin safe technology to remove cuts and nicks and after a few moments griff looked fresh and now the ladies can't get enough of him get off my car get off my car you can also get the pro kit that has the luxury beard hedger along with beard shampoo to keep a squeaky clean beard and oils to keep your beard looking and smelling fresh use code harvest at checkout and get 20 off free shipping and two free gifts thank you manscape for sponsoring this video but i made a mistake oh  i'm targeted oh let me know if you die please i'm done in bed minnie's fine minnie's fine i don't know if i'm in say something or not you are you are hitting the ground to find the stash made outpost target so i was just gonna wait the timer out but then everything went wrong all at once  thank you the people who owned the gate had came online and started raiding our base but we wouldn't go down without a fight right now oh they're shooting at us calm down i killed when i killed one yeah me too well the situation at home was looking pretty rough rallo had some of his own problems to deal with that outpost oh it's lagging oh i don't know what's happening it's lagging so hard oh my god oh my god oh my god my god what's happening what's happening what's happening game bro what is the server doing it's not the  the  server man it's lagging so hard oh my god dude what is this leg he'd need to deal with that on his own but let's get back to saving our base keep watching keep watching one's lit one's the last one's lit him that's nice i got to be here we had fallen off the raiders and saved the base so we immediately started to use the leftover high qual to upgrade our base and as for bralo he wasn't doing too good you guys serious  stupid look at you all what do you think you're gonna do what was that lag after that happened we started to build up our base making sure that we'd be ready for any future attack that came from top down through doors basically anywhere but then we had a visitor and his name looked familiar oh we got their intern it was one of the raiders i was a little skeptical but i let him say what he wants y'all are pretty damn good i can't even lie bro we're just we're just trying to build in the uh you got to come over here all like angry like and try to rate us instantly bro what the  i don't know it wasn't my idea to go in that's all i have to say so who are you guys you guys you guys are running this already or did you guys raid those people i don't think there's no this was rent this was ran by someone else this was not ours but didn't you open the gate doesn't that get yours so so basically because we put that gate so here i'll explain that base over there and this base over here got raided but i don't know if there was the same people but they got rated but we didn't get raided because we built after they got raided and that's literally it i mean what are you guys looking to do are you guys looking to be aggressive or something like we can be friendly i don't mind i don't mind being friendly we don't have to ally or anything but like yeah just don't don't come up here and try to race again because we might have to retaliate that time kiddo okay all right akita seemed like he wanted to be peaceful but there was one thing that he said that put me off what's everyone's name just i'm curious in rust if you're an offline scum you keep track of everyone's names of the group that you want to rate then when you're given the opportunity you strike and this was probably what he was doing or he was trying to be friendly i don't know but i'm sure we'll figure out his true intentions pretty soon for now just to be safe we tc'd off the gate that they own and i went back to outpost got my body a mini copter and we began the process of exploiting the quarry this would be the first round but the goal would be to run the quarry constantly producing 3 000 high quality metal per hour enough to upgrade a base like this to armor so we started running it but suddenly there was a familiar face at our game and it was one of our neighbors who let us trade him for the code to the gate now with full access to the quarry we had no obstacles in our way to getting infinite high quality metal and we were prepped and ready to run this for hours so we did at the start it was a lot of flying going back and forth to outpost the style the hqm to keep the quarry running but as it went on it got a lot easier and we were getting rich we even developed a new strategy to transport the high qual using shop drone taking a little profit away from us but making it a whole lot quicker but quick was not fast enough as we slowly figured out that this process had you sitting around for hours doing nothing and for the amount of teammates we have we might as well farm high qual on our own because 75 high call per hour per person is easily doable so we decided to stop for the night not at all prepared for what was to come       oh god there's like five what the  how deep are they right now uh they're still getting past the world    our initial suspicions were right kita had waited until we were offline and tried to take us out but it wouldn't be as easy as he thought okay oh god all right all right they're guarding no i'm gonna i'm gonna start repairing three two  three seconds repairing repairing repairing okay okay let's say this okay okay i just say it's a bit oh they're going for the park i can't even get it we gotta break into it really broke it i got i got you see though i got it oh god huh go you go thank you let's see let's see on the top okay okay not not the core though not the core not the core wait we could shop the stuff out get get the outpost quick get down first get to help us make sure you do the full quantity please yes thank you  how much did you just get out 1600 how to call it with all the high qual safely transported to outpost it was time to end this rage there's no one in here harvest if you want to see you can see one now sealed smith card that's armored the uh there's so many of them oh this is a 36. thanks babe let's go girls station below as well there's this one okay we're good we're good it's eight more rockets eight more rockets that's fine all right yeah slit all this a little bit everybody in there i know i know it can be admitted okay now while the methods we used to defend were a bit scummy they just tried to offline us so i think it's pretty fair but there's someone we need to talk to boys boys we need to talk guys i log off for 20 minutes and my base gets rated by the people who i'm friendly with what the  bro we were friends we were allies matt what do you mean we were actually friendly with you guys why do you have to try and raid us dude manipulated man no no no no no no no no no no no no no no yeah yeah it's their fault no it's your fault for listening bro what the  bro we were friends we had all those good times together what the  this wasn't how i was supposed to go down we had conversation right when we first met nice conversation it wasn't my idea trust me come on okay we could have done like had something to lay together as a it's frozen now what exactly do you do when your trust is completely betrayed well we just decided to make their life a living hell yeah go go fish door right there you gotta jump jump or just  blob  oh i got a lower  let's go buddy let's go oh my god oh my god my brain take off the doors bro  yeah yeah bro listen listen what's up with your team man what's up with your team the trust we had between each other you gave us the code lock we paid you man i just go with the flow i haven't been betrayed in rust in a long time but for some reason i still trusted this dude so i asked him to help screw over his scummy friends if he could uh could slide us into the base you know there's literally nothing in the base hold on just open it then like what's the point it's just a waste of time i know i just need to get back at the kid kid like dude he doesn't give a  about anything he really doesn't care anymore he literally logged off he's off the chinese character kids that was our last day bro peter then gave me a tour of his base and he wasn't lying almost every single item had despawned do you really want to play with these guys wait so it actually just thought so there was like a ton of  on the ground so you actually just despawned everything yep but we literally this one everything it was their idea after scavenging what was left i brought him up to the room there i explained the exploit that we had been abusing i did not know it was glitch but it was time to say goodbye well i think that's it i appreciate you being so cool dude sure you ready before you killed me anything else i hope you all have a good rest of your night enjoy the super bowl tomorrow that's it you can kill me now i'm about to log off akita's a weird case sometimes every game just isn't meant for everyone but i hope he finds a group that treats him right or maybe he was the evil mastermind behind every plan all along blaming others to trick me into trusting him but we'll really never know as for the high qual we gave it to some duda outpost along with the base and the rest of the stuff so if you like this video check out this one you'll probably like it,2023-04-29T22:40:35Z
Z7F5c0DHFks,Infecting Rust Players Bases,1868477,48080,2775,0 days 00:38:46,raiding in rust can be demotivated but what if there is a way to make every raid profit what if you could rate a base normally place bags cameras and even a way back in and watch as they build up their base gather resources waiting for the perfect moment to strike at least this was the idea coming into this way but it got a whole lot crazier than we expected you see this is a continuation of the wipe where i got 1 million sulfur in vanilla rust afterwards brala was tasked with using the 1 million sulfur in 24 hours and when he figured out that that was way too much sulfur for what he had planned i decided i would free him of some of his burden and with us being set up with more than enough kits in launchers from brawlow's raids we were ready to infect some bases  colors we then infected one more base totaling up to four infected bases and all we had to do for now is just wait foreign  as you can see from the cameras we weren't very successful people were logging on and checking their base out but no one made any progress one person managed to lose all their items in their base overnight so this was going to be much more difficult than we initially thought and the worst part about this is that each base took almost an hour to set up so it was pretty demotivating but we weren't gonna stop now if anything it was perfect people weren't even finding the cameras so why not make the amount of bases we have infected double  okay it hit the body oh my god foreign so far we had about six bases infected all around our area and the plan was to raid two more bases but i was out of pipes and even though i had access to 250 000 sulfur pipes are still a crucial component in crafting rockets but as i said at the start of the video bralo had the task of using 1 million sulfur in 24 hours and he still had a good amount of rockets to use so i joined him on his next raid to hopefully get some pipes but this wouldn't be easy like the other raids we did this raid would prove to be much more of a challenge introducing us to enemies we'd have for the rest of the way   we were rating a double layered stone compound filled with turrets and basically on its own island this was going to be tough but before we rated the compound i actually joined bralo on an online raid on a smaller base and while we raid this base let me tell you about pine hosting oh have you ever wanted to play russ without worrying about getting raided like what's about to happen to this dude pine hosting has you covered within minutes you can create a server that's super easy to use high performing and affordable and best of all you can choose from any of their locations worldwide  ggs and they also have a built-in u mod plugin installer so you can install plugins with a click of a button s pine hosting also has the pine ai feature that's able to detect server errors in seconds block by brawler and the best part about all this is that they're offering you 30 off with code harvest at checkout using the link in the description below thank you pine hosting for sponsoring this video as for the bass we just rated they barely had any posts so we moved on to the double layered stone compound and so after we landed bralo focused on building the raid base uphill while i took a group to scout out the base and it seemed quiet but what we didn't know is that they just weren't home yet and would be returning pretty soon  just like  protection you can't  wait oh my god they're all open they're all open up yo no shot oh low grade low grade and crude and there it was we had gotten the pipes that we were after so we boomed a little bit more and they decided to go home in depot but before we do let me introduce you to wang wang is one of our teammates and he said this i got up all the piping to tell me too now since weighing had all the pipes there's no way for him to lose them with all of us bunched together right is everyone alive mercedes dead there's only one dead bro oh my god bro you guys brick we got something to do man just land and kill the guys we need to kill them just go with us being ambushed we had no choice but to leave the area the biggest issue is that wang had died and we had lost all the pipes that we were after so once we deposited the loot that we had on us we headed back trying to recoup our losses but we did not know that we would be heading into a war zone terrified i don't have code bro i don't know why you would f1 code you're getting picked okay another one another one another one here another one he's right right behind his face davey no no i just want to see if i can control i'm dead he's headshot hit it the base owners were back and had sealed up the rain but not all was lost because braulo managed to get all the pipes back from a few bodies he found so now all we had to do was get out of here alive and that would be a challenge in itself come on dad there's the one super close i'm done that's jazz bro these guys homelander someone try to loot me now he's trying to run and three times three times he's knocked he's down um the role player so far we had seen three names from the group that countered us jazz homelander and the role player and since these three were consistently coming back they had to have a base on the same island but for now we left in our scrappy and would have to deal with them again soon however we now had enough pipes to raid so we crafted rockets and infected two more bases and since it was pretty late i crafted the rest of our gunpowder and sulfur into explosives for two hours and then i went to bed hoping that tomorrow we'd actually get someone to fall for one of our infected bases  thank you if i could save time in a bottle first thing that i'd like to do is to save every day to eternity passes away just to spend them with you but it could make days last forever if words could make wishes come true i'd save every day like a treasure and then again i would spend them with you we had been offline rated at 6 00 am our base was completely hollowed out from the top down by some dude named bob marley we didn't know who he was but all we knew is that he had all of our armor guns and especially all the explosives i crafted last night or did he well you see you can actually put explosives in tool cupboards so that's what i did before logging off last night so while we did lose all of our kits and components we still had the explosives so we moved in with sigbog's group net store and when we were almost done transferring everything salvageable over that's when we saw this oh oh look at him he's in there he's in the base infected base number five was online and now before you see what happened you need to know that this was the first pace this worked on and we didn't really know what to do so we just decided to with them and trust me as more infected base owners came online the ways in which we with them just got better and better but for this base in particular the plan was stupid but simple my friend monty would bring a handheld phone and a note over to their base the base owners would go inside call my phone and we'd be able to spy on them while they're talking to us making them think that someone was inside of their base and the plan worked perfectly hello yeah what can i do for you bro bro he keeps hanging it up hell what's up bro you gotta stop hanging up you gotta stop stop hanging up bro if i my cat ran across the cross how you guys doing i gotta ask okay go on the camera wait why you gotta stand on the disguise toast box that's kind of weird look down oh look down you see that skin on that box this cycle you know he noticed he noticed he noticed what what do you mean no he's not he's sorry i'm going back okay what are you talking about we don't have a camera he's looking right ahead after that dicey ice was pretty chill about the whole thing and whoever put that camera there's a genius just wait until you find the other one oh chill out there's another one bro so we went back to check on the rest of the bases and we had a problem some of the bases were the case so we decided that we would infect 10 more bases and while setting up one of the bases on the same island that we previously raided on we found this bro look at this there happened to be an almost fully metal base that perfectly lined up with where the three counter raiders are coming from before and figuring out who lived here would not be that hard done oh another one inside base oh i downed him i downed him while i didn't see their name one of my teammates did and it was the role player we had found the counter raiders but simply countering one of our raids wouldn't warrant a revengery but soon they'd do something much much worse regardless i still needed to finish up infecting 10 more faces but with only two more bases to go rather than doing the sensible thing and infecting two more bases i decided to go counter a raid with 22 rockets in my inventory while risky if we win this counter raid we might be able to infect this base and as i said before infecting bases takes hours to do so i just needed a change in pace and this gave me much more than that okay  oh my god  sorry sorry silencer i'm dead i'm dead pronouncing at all i'm done  oh my god you heard that those rockets in here we gotta hold this  my crosshair was on the entire time on lender this was the second time that homelander's group had lost a counter rate to us and since the base we rated was so close to their base we decided to not infect it and to rather fly around to look for more bases to infect and to check out their base but that was a big mistake they had upgraded so much in fact that they now had double layered walls multiple sam sites auto turrets and we were screwed and we had just lost our mini without a mini and no means of escape we giving them two free fold kits and their first true win against us so we just moved on to finishing infecting the last two bases and when infecting one of the two there was a bit of a situation we had been raiding and infecting the space like normal and when we flew home to get some more materials something was different uh can you go on the camera protect there's someone in this base there's someone in it yeah there's a guy in there there was a guy inside of the base that we were trying to infect and i knew this because the doors didn't have locks in them before and now they did and he had to remove the lock because it would just ruin the base so i had to try and get him out but let me warn you this led to one of the strangest interactions i've ever had playing rust what does he have he's naked i think bro what's the plan  so now this kid was having a rough day and this game was hard sometimes so i decided to try and make his day hey bro listen listen i'll give you i'll give you an ak if you unlock it yeah i'd be down you just gotta drop your gun on the ground and not come out with the gunner stand right against the door stand right against the door you have a revolver i see that okay put it away just take like a tool out or something take a tool okay salvage sword that's good enough open the door open the door i will not kill you but there is nothing in here bro this is this is bigger than you think this is bigger than you think i just i just need you to to come out nothing out like this is no good i'm not i'm not come out with the come out with the sword i will not i promise i promise i will not if you come out with the sword okay we're good okay please please take the lock off and then just drop your weapons drop your weapons drop them drop them drop them okay go against the wall 150 go against the wall okay now just stand there stay there stay there okay i will give you an ak okay i'm dropping stuff underneath you to pick up and then you will leave okay there you go you can take your stuff yeah you can take it you can take it okay you can leave now i just want to hear you jump out of the compound jump out run after he struggled to leave torch i do not have a torch he finally managed to exit the compound and sammy if you're watching this i hope you're having a better day dude but for now it was time to infect the final base because we were running out of rockets and motivation and the base we picked was the biggest yet  oh my god there's a shotgun trap in there brother it's the weirdest place i've ever seen in my life this just looks so infectable while the base was weird what is this pro it was also perfect because it had no external tool coverage meaning we could place whatever we want and we did we placed bags three different cameras hidden by bear rugs and one safe room that had a battery to power all the cameras a bag and a camera that could actually see through the wall this is thanks to mr flax video titled the impossible glitch key go and check his video out if you want to see how this works as for the base it was all set up so we filled up their tc left a hopefully convincing note and logged off thinking we were ready for the day to come but that was not the case foreign the biggest space that we infected base 13 was online and every single camera that we had in there was still functional but there was a problem you see the battery in there had a limited time before it ran out of the charge and all the cameras turned off so we only had 23 more hours to mess with them but the only problem is that i was the only one who had a bag in the space and i probably won't be successful messing with them on my own i needed someone sneaky enough to mess with them with me so let me introduce you to the self-proclaimed sneakiest player in rust baz you might have seen baz in any of these fancy or videos and he was here to help me out sneak around their base but first he needed a bag so we initiated operation bag bad here's how it should go we treat this like a payday mission i'd spawn it at night free tech would be on the cams and i'd walk around to my bag if it's a baz and hide in a corner and f1 kill hopefully without bumping into any of the base owners while doing so while it sounds simple i might have gotten a little greedy operation okay okay here let's do it that's it that's it i'm gonna try it get all my cams for a second i see you oh my god where do i go all right i have a bag right here hold up  hold on hold on oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no i hear him give pass okay okay okay okay okay okay guys you have a bag okay can i loot some stuff okay okay i'm gonna try to loot this is really bad footage but it's fine oh they're outside to get off cams they're not they're not moving inside yet oh my god i see they're coming in they're coming in they're coming they're coming in oh my god oh my god they're in here okay we're dead one arm is one arm with the operation being a success we now needed some more information about them so we could determine when to spawn in and start taking stuff from them but before we got that something was different about the bass oh they moved stuff why did they move the furnaces disregarding that for now baz and i headed over to talk to them what do we want from this we want to just see when they're gonna leave we need to get the information out of them i don't know it's it's social engineering or social hacking hello is anyone in there yeah how can i help hey what's up i saw you got raided last night why are you still on the base they didn't grief it no bro they left a lot of stuff they didn't grip it so that was pretty nice i guess do you know who was by any chance what what is this is  i see you in that window you know who raped last night no i

look what happened to me one arm bandit seemed like a nice dude so we'd hold off on messing with him till later for now we still had eight non-decade bases and it was only a matter of time until one started the show signs of life oh upgraded like a bit it wasn't dude there was a literally okay there's and how many of you are there is this your base is this your base right here weed pen yeah i stay here on the weekends didn't this uh didn't this place get raided i'm pretty sure it did did you guys raid this base no did it get raided though we saw it yeah pretty sure i'm pretty sure it did i swear to god the walls got replaced and everything was missing besides a couple guns a couple pieces of  like uh what is it called thompson but i couldn't tell but i was like maybe i was in stone last time i played so i just kept playing so what i think we got raided but i'm not too sure you know like when someone raids and then puts the walls back i think that's what happened to us but i'm not too sure were you were like reverse rated or something something like that okay that's kind of weird i never heard of that before i don't know because our front door was missing and our ladder hatch was missing and i could have sworn our back two walls were sheet and now they're stoned but i'm i don't know i swear i might just say hi bro he grabbed a db by the way okay hey why are you grabbing a tv

layout so you see how there's a extra triangle here that wasn't here before your ladder hatch wasn't that triangle dude no way what the mine is balloon right now after blowing weed pen's mind we left him be and went to go check out how one arm bandit was doing but something wasn't right wait wait wait all the cameras is out all of them no just one 133 in between us talking to one arm and weed pen one of the cameras had been taken down i immediately spawned in and checked the branches and it seemed like it had just been picked up and also i still had building privilege but then the situation got a whole lot worse no no what no they just took it down no way it just took 133 the 131 no that was a good one it was literally like in the last minute it pass i think we spawned inside i think it's time i think it's time hey do you know where the base you know their bases you already spawned oh no i'm coming i think the razor the the doors are open hi they're not rated i got to see it wait

stairs with us learning the truth about this dude we made sure to grab every single item we could spare to give him don't shoot don't shoot apparently can you let us inside and we'll drop it all inside i don't need this anymore take all those oh bro are you guys leaving the server now no no we got a few more bases to in fact bro i i just can't stop smiling bro you guys are crazy now one arm bandit is probably the nicest dude i've ever met while playing this game and i want to try and make a difference in his life so i asked him to make a gofundme and here it is you can scan the qr code or click the link in the description all the money goes directly to him to help him fit his arm with the ultimate goal of getting a myomo exoskeleton to give him some function back i wasn't involved at all in making the gofundme and i just want to try and give this dude his arm back so please if you're able donate any amount and thank you so much to anyone that does right after giving one arm bandit all the loot his teammate asked for a favor you know uh we could use your help you know there's these kids on the island they've been with us a lot we couldn't accept it right now because we're still trying to stay on task and monitor the infected bases but that's when something unexpected happened and out baby zombie  oh the ring they're getting ready  where are they where are they where are they open core you guys are stealing it you're good  are you good yeah i'm good wait wait give me the rockets give me the rockets i need to read their raid base uh rockets i ain't thinking about bro we should we should uh combine our rocks and raid them one arm bandit a discord invite join that discord we thought they had left so we got in discord with one arm bandit and started adding his team two hours but that was only round one yeah apparently y'all uh you know that oh yeah right  back from the back of the room  monster i killed two yes there's three left awesome you got it going you gotta come on right now okay come on   done another one  dead okay all that all dead oh my god so that was the role players group the same people we've been fighting this whole time and now they try to take one arm bandit out so with the priorities of our wipe shifting and thus not actually dating or base to mess with the rest of the infected bases i gave one arm bandit a choice so vargas you see this base yeah uh we don't need it anymore you want it can i give you a hug i love it i love it so listen the space has 90 rockets in it and you gotta you got a decision do you want to keep the rockets to raid like different bases or we could all coordinate and go one final send-off on the role player win or lose doesn't matter we go one final assemble to role play it was decided we use the rest of our rockets to raid the role player someone we fought throughout the entire white but we weren't the only ones with resentment towards them you see one arm bandit only had four people in his group but this whole area was a village and we're all annoyed with the role player and we're willing to help we are raiding the role player hey everybody you can get together please and everyone helped before we knew it we were set up and ready to finish this way after the longest seven days of our lives these are underrated is it possible to farm one million sulfur in vanilla rest my friend braulo and i decided we'd give it a try hey you were all peasants and nothing more than a peasant and we had done it what exactly am i gonna do with one million sold traded well over 20 bases and when he figured out that that was way too much sulfur for what he had planned i decided i would free him with some of his burdened i just can't stop smiling oh bubbles     they have church remember they have turrets  rocket deep rocket deep foreign  we were already in their core and any attempt they made to defend was easily shut down we couldn't place anything because of external tcs so we made sure to grab everything we could and then we gathered all the loot that was in the raid base and headed home we were sad we didn't get the grand back and forth raid we hoped for we knew they got the message and it was finally time to log off one last time everyone's gonna the camera's gonna be facing the t-base which is east it's gonna be facing east of your email in three two one go  so much for watching and just a reminder please donate anything you can to the gofundme and if you're curious none of the other infected bases ever came back online so check out us getting 1 million sulfur if you haven't yet but if you did you'll like this video instead foreign ,2023-04-16T11:29:58Z
rPZyWaWK65Y,"Farming 1,000,000 Sulfur In Vanilla Rust",422758,12297,553,0 days 00:16:12,is it possible to farm one million sulfur in vanilla rest this is what 1 million sulfur looks like and fun fact it's never been done before so my friend bralo and i decided we'd give it a try but how alone it would take you 42 hours of straight farming to collect the over 3 300 nodes required and that's assuming there's an average of 100 meters between each node basically we need some help as an homage to getting paid to play rust i'd be hiring a few fiverr farmers to help farm sulf and instead of supplying them with metal pickaxes we opted for jackhammers and ortiz because it would be 10 times faster and 50 more efficient to make sure we had enough to supply the undetermined amount of farmers the goal was to get 100 jackhammers and 100 priorities so we started farming some scrap for jackhammers tasty oh i'm dead  up oh my god bro but first a huge thank you to our sponsor raid shadow legend

located in d7 allowing us access to the ranch for horses which we would take full advantage of later on in the freshwater river letting us build the most efficient berry farm in russ able to produce 30 warranties per hour it'd be up to brawlow to get the 100 pure ortiz and i still needed to get over 14 000 scrap to purchase the 100 jackhammers so after i built up the base and crafted some guns i went back to farming killer claus stop  couldn't do nothing in kindle labs i'm doing something he's clipping you  yeah i know i'm running around the river out of my goddamn mind what the  did i just say to you bro oh my god like i've been doing just all goddamn day i have like this is my my five minutes of freedom that was killer claus him and koala will be joining us for this way and they both had some skills that would be much more useful later on since we live right next to labs we decided to run it for two hours straight getting us near the halfway point of scrap even in vanilla but it was getting pretty repetitive so i went to farm some stone because we needed to build the place where all the sulfur farmers will live and let me introduce you to the farmhouse 25 individual rooms allowing for maximum capacity but still feeling like you're right at home with the possibility of 25 people joining us to farm we need someone who will be used to leading large groups this is fancy orange someone who has led hundreds of people in all of these videos today his job would be to keep the sulfur farmers on task by motivating them to be well prepared for the sulfur farmers we still needed jackhammers i just needed to continue farming scrap but first i needed to come home for my stone farm run alive oh good guys on me oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god there's four of them there's four guys on me if you want to come to me i know you got kurt can you hold on i'm running to uh they're chasing they're chasing there's at least three four oh they're going to kill me i think let's get them out in this field get on this field they're running straight towards me oh my god well i can get a jump on him right now hit 10 shots i think one's dead one dead two dead there's still two inside okay two are inside the walls two are inside the walls joined us to help build a raid defense system to keep the million sulfur safe instead he'd only bring five people with him but that ended up being a lot more than we expected since he had such a large group he was able to contribute 5 000 scrap in raw scrap and components to buy the 100 jackhammers after recycling some of our own leftover components we were only 2500 scrap away from our goal before farming some more scrap bralo had the task of getting 100 pure ortiz and said the majority of the work was done by tigaitan so tom has the uh has a farmer been going it's going good actually we got a lot of teas already made where where do you have what wait yeah we're already on it dude how many seasons he got know like a 150 or something i'm not sure check that box right there just throwing them in that box lately and just stacking them up christ tom afterwards we set up a shop and sold teas for 50 scrap each and after winning about 12 hours we had gotten enough scrap to buy all the jackhammers so we did and after getting the sulfur farmers set up in the farmhouse it was finally time to begin farming let me tell you something all right boys gather around gather around you guys might think you know you're excited to be in this video you know which you should be but don't think this is just gonna be a good time all right today you are all peasants and nothing more than a peasant you're gonna be farming sulfur like a little all of you are little  look at you little  and you're cute this little ninja suits all right you're either gonna find all the sulfur today i'm gonna make sure you guys are farming your asses off today you're gonna farm you all the  silver and i'll decide if you get paid or not all right does that might get that message they're  peasants i'll go  farm some sulfur fancy mentioned payment since the promise of being in a video is not enough motivation for these 20 farmers to spend countless hours farming sulfur we were going to have to pay them the deal was for every 30 000 sulfur they farmed they get ten dollars everything went well one million sulfur would cost about three hundred and thirty dollars but it did not go well regardless each farmer would be provided with four sets of jackhammers ortiz horses and basic gear sets and if you're curious about team ui the server that we chose tickle thin oil monthly had no team ui limit so it would not be an issue and with everything set it was finally time for the farmers to actually hit a node   i thought it was so much not even 20 minutes in and we already had some issues you see this was three days into a monthly life so there were already massive bases all around the map especially the snow the place with the most sulfur spawns so we decided to group up the farmers into four separate groups with their team leads hopefully keeping them grouped together as they farm but since there was money involved this was not the best plan  foreign but let's see how fancy is doing motivating the farmers you're good hey you're  slacking all right go find some sulfur and go start hitting dude what are you doing stop looking at me like you're an idiot you idiot dumbass you're gonna save my horse go  farm and be productive since fancy had some questionable methods no one had brought back any sulfur yet so i had an idea first person to bring back 30k in their bots gets 20 on top of the ten dollars on top of the ten dollars so you're gonna get thirty dollars for that first spot with the bonus in place some teams started to have an unfair advantage you see koala the best pile in rust was flying around a fancy orb but killer the second best pilot in russ was flying around with team four brawlow's team he would fly to each farmer pick up the sulfur and fly it back to base allowing them the farm without having the depot since none of the other teams had this luxury team four member laser got the 20 bonus in less than 30 minutes and if i knew this was happening i would have tried to make it more fair so thank you brala speaking about fairness fancy orb managed to get a farmer killed oh oh this guy this farmer's a goat he's killing me good all right i won't yell at this guy good oh boy headshot body might be dead wait maybe i did yeah i'm i'm on the left here i'm above this and made this to me did our guy our homie died oh he had solver i don't know hey that doesn't count we'll take that for free it's more so for us boys let's go ain't no way ain't no way he's getting this back sorry buddy you got looted by the other guy who was uh who is uh buka buka that's fancy oh yeah well he he should have my stuff uh fancy do you have broke records stuff whatever his name is stuff apparently that's what he just said the guy who just got it yeah yeah unfortunately someone got his silver so he's gonna oh okay aka yeah we got a silver but you know we're not gonna tell him why would we paid someone who failed their mission and would have lost all that sulfur was it for me koala to save him we literally had a carrier in this dumbass so get back to farming i was the one who died with all that sulfur wait was that you man bro we tried to get him but he ran away he looted your body we saw your body um and he pretty much glued all the goods no shot really yeah unlucky man ah i had like 10 000 sulfur on me ain't no way we'll get back to confirming all right go get that  back i'm so evil hey if you're watching this and it is something that makes in the video i'm so sorry told me that that kid got away with the sulfur and i i don't know damn it i'll i'll add it to your cat how much did you have 9k okay i'll add it to your account it's fine uh fancy you pissed someone up did he really yeah we're going right to him yo throw what the  happened man why'd you snitch on me i'm getting yelled at by my boss below me goodbye after that situation people kept dying and losing their horses so i bought horses for 45 minutes straight and while i was doing that we got an official count on the sulfur so far after about two hours we had 72 000 sulfur according to my calculations we should have been at 1 million sulfur by now so we need to make a few changes but before we could things took a turn for the worse oh he was cheating one of the sulfur farmers was caught cheating you see half of the farmers were from my discord and half were from fiverr you wouldn't be surprised if he caught a random discord member hacking but i did not it's about the fiverr farmer to be espn node then bralo brought up a good point he put any sulfur in his box i'll check it i'll check it uh room four all right okay uh yeah he has 50 sulfur i'll just spawn after getting rid of all his sulfur we banned him and had a well-needed group leader in which we decided to start protecting the farmers more and merge team one and two and team three and four but before the meeting ended i said this i'll make it fifty dollars fifty dollars fifty dollars fifty dollars for the next person who brings me back 30k sulfur and let me tell you this worked   thank you i can just remember more he's oh my god he's full outside of the metal the last few group farming runs went well and we gotta count on the sulfur so far that's the final count not bad not bad should we tell them how much we have so far yeah so in total we have 340 000 sulfur farms we were over a third of the way there things were going well but as they usually do all good things came to an end there's a guy in the compound aka full metal oh that's mine there is a blatant hacker in our compound and there is nothing we could do as he killed us look at him oh he's in there he's flying took our mini and an inventory of our farmer's sulfur and dumped it in the ocean and i also suspected something oh is it the is it the kid scientist s the fiverr kid if this was true the same scientist that got banned was bad and the implications of that can ruin everything he could esp straight to the million sulfur he could keep coming back on different accounts he could even just call us out and chat and ruin everything but for now we just needed to kill him immediately he's dead got him got him oh look at that dude i killed him i fully killed the hacker bro soon after he got banned oh let's go yeah he's gone he's gone but we were definitely still worried that he come back so we set up some peacekeeper turrets and after it cooled down one of the farmers said he had enough to claim the 50 bonus okay now let me introduce you to beam and demon he was the one who just claimed the 50 bonus and here's what he had to say when i introduced the final bonus also by the way a person who farms the most sulfur gets a hundred dollars oh i'm going all night yeah i'm not going to sleep i didn't take him seriously at the time but i definitely should have because this man was a farming machine and he'll prove that to us pretty soon regardless with the hacker threat still present we moved as much sulfur as we could to the core of our base after we got a final count the count was 431 000 sulfur and here's how much everyone farmed and was getting paid so far we then logged off praying that the hacker did not return overnight when i log back on our base was all right so i tallied up all the sulfur that the farmers had got overnight and we had done it we had gotten one million sulfur in vanilla rust more specifically beam and demon had done it the psycho stayed up all night farming he farmed 251 000 sulfur contributing over a quarter of the million the rest of the farmers counts are on screen and here's a quick run through of all the boxes and regrouped everyone up and took a final group picture very good  after all the hardships the debts the hackers the funny moments and the not so funny moments we had completed our goal so what the  do we do now i don't know i mean we could use it if you want to see bralo somehow use one million sulfur check out this video if it's not out yet check out brawlow hiring the best tea farmer in rust,2023-01-07T14:45:29Z
cpu2d449_nY,Can You Still Be A Parasite in Rust?,948226,32904,1147,0 days 00:09:13, living under arrest players bases having over 7 million views it's one of the biggest rust videos of all time the video features a pretty deceptive base one that can be taken over by an unsuspecting victim and when the time is right the owner would spawn underneath break the floor and get all of their loot so a few months ago i had an idea after seven million people saw the base could it still work to make sure i was in the clear to record this i messaged the creator of the video zechum now zichon being one of the biggest creators in rust he wouldn't respond to me right especially someone trying to recreate the same base to use in this video oh he responded with my newfound confidence i got my friend brolo on and i started farming for the bases now the goal was to place eight bases down giving the bases the greatest chance to succeed but it was white day so the server was packed and since there were only two of us we might not get all eight bases down with this in mind we made sure to put our starter in a spot that wouldn't be too contested but would still allow us to access the majority of the map so we started putting some bases down foreign   decided to build above us i was building right above us who the  i'm hit good one climbing up dead what the using the resources from farming notes and the kill we easily put phase two down but base three would be a little more challenging foreign 's outside again crossing head shot him i'm here missed the pushes for me yep am i left grandmother i'm dead you're dead my foe got retracted when i fell off i found it headshot dad got him get them both after we cleared out base three we farmed up as much stone as we could hold in our base and put base four five and six down but before we logged off someone was living in base one he's already asleep are you who the in here i don't think he changed anything after investigating blaster's base a bit more we logged off and hoped for the best  okay  come on it's decaying there's nothing left  come on this is the last one and yeah six out of the six bases we put down were decaying and empty there were just too many people who knew about the base in an attempt to salvage this i reached out to the only person who would know what to do zechum you made six and didn't get anyone yeah you gotta you gotta bait them in gotta bait him in you know what zechum was right if we're gonna do this correctly we gotta listen to the dude who did it first this time we'd use two different tactics to bait the players in and also we switched from our weekly server to a monthly server and actually had a plan this time the first part of the plan involved getting lots and lots of scrap with the scrap we need to research some guns to protect ourselves from these kind of encounters to do so we put our starter down right in the middle of the map and began by running some nearby monuments i hear someone hello piggy you have a base in there it is  what's wrong after dealing with those npcs i got pretty lucky okay there you go there's this after having a tier two being handed to us we crossed off the second part of our plan found some loot from a decayed base thought and researched some guns from outpost and completed our plan so we put two bases down and logged off for the night if you notice we forgot something fundamental something that might dictate the entire course of our way oh we're not rooted base is just a kang so yeah the base did end up decaying oh so we rebuilt the base got b george and destroyer on and we put base three four five six and seven down however for base eight we'd use some tactics by giving base eight to a nice dude named this is the base you you were gonna give me the cool two by two yeah yeah it's a cool two by two right this was your starter base we took all the boxes we gave you some uh some resources to start out with oh we got you a bow thank you thank you oh we're just feeling nice all right well you guys you guys are very good people we then put the final two bases down base nine and ten and got a message from duck in the chat in that direction  when we were about to log off we put some honeycomb on base 10 by making it less obvious that it's from zechum's video look look at that yes oh we got one it had worked waiting them in brought us a tiny jackpot of a base on top of that five out of the ten bases had doors on them and weren't decaying to make sure the bases would be the juiciest when we opened them we waited one more day uh after waiting all that time and waking up in a compound for some reason there were only four bases left base two four six and ten so we decided to open base six first  oh yeah okay it's fine it was a horse races after that flop of a base we still had three bases left base two the sheet door base four the wooden door and base 10 the mini jackpot so when we went for base four there were some people outside who were curious about what we were doing nothing renovating they're renovating yeah they asked us to come in here listen we were trying to get rid of some squatters in our base yeah there's squatters bro they were they arrangements yeah these people came in here put a door on our base like you just want to take it back you you have like the you're coming through the floors right yes yes we do but apparently we just can't get any loot from these bases so we went and opened base two and surprisingly we actually did get something from this one oh wait wait we got some loot over here okay okay we got some loot oh my god okay oh 786 scrap yo that's actually that's great oh wait oh i should make the campfire like asap okay we need to get this out we need to get this to someone with this base having much more loot than expected we found a korean dude named biom to give the loot to but we decided to open the mini jackpot first just in case i had more loot to give him oh okay oh okay okay okay okay okay yo 750 oh oh holy crap box all guns oh my god oh my gosh oh my god with the mini jackpot being well a jackpot zechum was right baiting them in by adding the honeycomb caused them to not be suspicious of the trap we then gave all the loot we got to be home and here's what he had to say wow um i love america are you dead yes if you like this video you'd like me getting paid to play rust where i farm sulfur for 10 hours straight it was not fun,2022-10-22T13:00:23Z
Sxz-zbjinQc,I Got Paid To Play Rust,548921,10993,421,0 days 00:08:20,sulfur the resource at the heart of all rust groups but why because it's the only resource that can lead to every other and also it's the only resource that rust players pay for on fiverr today we're gonna use that to our advantage to do so i made a fiver gig offering to farm 100 nodes for only five dollars that's five cents a node and after waiting and waiting and wait is that an order but before i take my first order i have to have a game plan first to quickly farm the nodes i have to get a jackhammer one of the best tools in the game second to get to nodes faster it'd be best if i got a full stamina horse ensuring no time wasted and third to have a safe place to depot near node spawns i should probably build a farm base so i wouldn't have to travel across the map to depot with the game plan set the question is how much can i really make per hour farming sulfur and also i did get an opportunity to use some of the almost 300 000 sulfur i farmed and let me tell you you do not want to miss that whatever happened i love you guys that was confusion and i'd be farming for him later in the video but anyway since this first customer paid five dollars i owed them 30 000 sulfur so 100 nodes worth and this little counter will let you know how much sulfur i have left to farm after looking around the server for a bit i stumbled across this decayed compound and tried my best to climb in looking for some loot to start out with and honestly it gave me a lot more than i expected really helping me get that farm base down come on come on yo jackhammer and a tommy brown look at all these tommies if there's no privilege what where to build the farm base oh   more scrap let's go where is it  after those pretty big come-ups i recycled for a bit of outposts and put down a farm base and with everything set up it's farming time after only having 10k left to farm i got this message from the buyer even though this did mean i'd get 15 extra dollars i would have to farm a hundred thousand more sulfur in total and based off the fact that it took one hour to farm 20k it would probably not be worth it but i agreed to it anyway so with 100k left to go i went to bed and when i woke up i found out i was offline but i found some loot from a decayed base i forgot to record so i sold some fertilizer for scrap bought another jackhammer got another horse and i was back to farming  i have so much sulfur in them oh my god oh my god after that absolutely terrifying encounter it turns out farming on an eu server on any times leads to little to no interactions so i farmed the rest of the sulfur with no issue sent all the sulfur to his shot and got paid 15 more dollars made about 3 dollars and 50 cents per hour and moved on to farming for confusion confusion with his never-ending youtube money offered 15 for each box of sulfur and i was gonna make that man broke we'd need a modified game plan for this since there were pure orti shops on the server allowing for greater mining efficiency fourth don't stop drinking tea pure ort provides 50 greater yield from nodes meaning for every 20k sulfur i farm i get 10k free filling up a box and giving me 15 of confusions money what's up guys   oh  let's go  oh  where where'd he go you're not dead what finally oh  bro you're running come on where are you yes jackhammer with me to be wanting those bozos i kept farming and i farmed up four full boxes of sulfur in our farm base and now the hardest part transferring it all to our main with a bunch of methods of transfer available i was just gonna send it and use a horse to get this done as fast as possible each one i did felt more nerve-wracking than the last since i had 15 dollars worth of sulfur on me when i'm about to get wounded because we live in a cave and i have to jump down a bucket but anyways with me luckily not seeing anyone on these runs on a 200 pop server i made sure to secure every last drop of sulfur in that farm base not leaving any behind so i can get the maximum payout after depoting all the sulfur i got a pay power seat from the man himself farming for 3 hours and 32 minutes in total making about 17 an hour and if you're wondering the first customer uses sulfur for fun but confusion he used it for revenge the revenge story is not mine to tell but i did help out in the raid using the sulfur i farmed and that sulfur went to help craft three boxes of rockets which is just under 300 rockets leading to a raid i will never forget  so  the outcome of this raid will be in confusion's fourth video in a series if you like this video you'd like me building a discount outpost it's like discounted prices ah whatever,2022-08-04T11:00:13Z
dqSeo4UMtMI,We Built a BETTER OUTPOST in Rust!,142574,2948,148,0 days 00:11:19,outpost is not the best it's filled with bad vibes bad hosts and worst of all bad deals to do the lovely people of rust right we decided to fix these issues but how introducing the first homemade outpost fully equipped with peacekeeper turrets amazing hosts great vibes and best of all great deals however to build this on an actual server we'll need to follow the game plan first find a place to build close to outposts so we can steal the maximum amount of customers second grind resources and components getting enough to make outpost deals look terrible and third decorate our outpost and host a grand opening so that we get the greatest amount of clients since the server wiped on mondays we only had two days to do this or it would be all for nothing because a dead server met no customers with the timer set we worked on finding a place to build and right around here looked perfect    perfect after getting our starter brace set up i went on a component run and it did not go as planned someone's doing a bow but there's a guy me all right there's a guy dress dealer can you get out of the basement what

TkYWHeXNRXM,How We Got 8 Boxes of Guns in Rust,39253,844,74,0 days 00:23:09,guns you can use them to shoot sell or sit in your boxes but how do you get them you can craft them raid for them buy them or the best way kill for them that's what our group set out to do get as many guns as possible while only playing on a weekly web server how many guns did we end up getting from taking heli to onlining roof campers to surviving rocket pvp i can say we ended up with a few guns but let me introduce you to the game plan number one establish a solid base to operate out of to ensure a low risk of getting raided number two pvp consistently in our area for a positive inflow of guns number three rate as many pvpers as possible to acquire the maximum amount of guns now that you're caught up our story starts wearing how everybody and rust begins as a naked on the beach well not exactly i got on late so we got a few guns already so we went on a farming run to help upgrade the base and got a little greedy see what it is oh oh just wait till it fully loads in oh my gosh movement inside the space that's too much it's gotta get actually moving inside this two by two right in front of me moving oh dead outside the 2x2 okay i want to do it i'm looking at the door you can't thought right click on this  hold up someone someone come to this camp no that was me that was me that's me that's

my teammate i don't know one more more you're insane oh my god go help him i aim at one he's dead i'm in another one he's already dead like what the  in front of us after whatever that was we found a good raid target that would hopefully get us a bunch of guns three guys in front of us uh one twenty one twenty coming this way can they run into us wait bait them they can distract them three times

these bags harper's can you after not getting the guns we were after from the online we made a shop and went out roaming for guns and tried to steal some from a roof camper twice twice there's someone about the base i think i swear i saw unless it was one of you oh  there's one right there he's lit up said him once that one all right that one's dead okay we need to push up and get that oh right in front right in front he's looting he's letting you that's okay i'm gonna i'm gonna get in with me get in with me max dead on the the roof that's on the ground right there make it behind your hearts yeah since cargo is always a great place for getting more guns i brought my friend htac and it did not go as expected people yeah you're dead your dad is out i shot him bro i don't know how i didn't kill him after that awesome cargo run we made a lad space ran labs and also took heli and got an m2 after the heli we were still searching for more guns so we went to take some from a nearby roof camper right in front of the road dead watch out for bolt tommy kit uh we can try to steal that mini yeah i'll cross some ladders hit three times two of them up there  i didn't bring fuel i'm deep oh never mind there's four full high call dudes in there seriously yeah  is there somebody climbing right maybe not  later that day we found an active 2x2 next to us and decided to give them an online there's a naked running up behind the base those guys ended up being pretty poor only owning a few kits that they had previously grubbed but we kept the ball rolling and online rated these bolt roof campers from before and hopefully we would finally get the guns we were looking for space to the left i'm running up top when i hear your tic take letters open there's a ton of garage doors in here oh the furniture space is open you're getting silenced i don't know from where uh up the hill up the hill 30 i think i see him uh up the hill 30 has he need to watch these doors someone get up top here please get on top uh expo okay it's about a break i can't be that guy on the hill 30 again throw down i i just fell off need to take guns off these counters oh my god there's so much i have really bad angles naked up on the hills 20 30. can't see him because of the rocks should be to i think to your left max i got the bolts gg easy it's another one it turns out these guys only had a handful of guns which led them to not give a great defense after the raid we needed metal for upkeep so we drove to excavator and got a little sidetracked on the way uh i'm lagging out i gotta go restart and then we can fight people or and then let the car and yeah i might want to restart as we can jump out and just kill them he's below he's jumping about this car down here yeah watch out i'm going i'm going oh my god oh my  god he's full yeah full entire it's from the water base that we passed you coming over and made money your car's unlocked oh my god i'm blogging the  out you didn't even look like it okay i didn't know i didn't i don't know i didn't know inventory for the third time go go go go go go go bounce boys oh this is it if i don't clutch this up we get set back to square one these are our best kits i only have to kill this one dude and get over this hill i'm down i'm dead what oh there's another one i killed him we went back and died again and lost all of the guns we just gained we cooled off with a raid nearby and got some loot but then found an active dome base and gave him an online hit someone who's in here he's in here oh  boys i just lit myself something there he is i'm watching bags yeah the door's open oh  oh  how did that not kill me okay watch out uh yeah i'm rocking that door okay it's all open i'm breaking cc another atc  these guys i want to give them some

started today we'll give you the base back yeah no no of course of course you guys ran by earlier too like um and he was like turn the furnaces off i was like dog no shot and then you guys just right when i heard you guys i really screamed in discord we're getting online and then the rockets went off after giving that dude his base and a thousand scrap bat we raided the guys from before who had the mini and we were hoping they were loaded with guns two of our ladders are still here okay you killed a guy oh oh four or oh i thought it was fortnite enjoyer  he had a full metal kit though that's a good sign oh  dude two l nines in this locker okay okay let's keep going what what oh sorry sorry oh sorry sorry man oh my  god it's armored door oh open yeah garage store the only thing you should remember oh my god there's it's juice that's that's pretty good but that's oh rocket launcher c4 armored signal seriously check that oh after getting the guns we were looking for from that raid we

or i see him oh forgot me he's dead he's dead perfect perfect tommy all right so we know there's people like 190 at the further side buildings we don't know if there's anyone at this close one if we could somehow take the close one it might be beneficial i think take the silo first and then if there's cover on it i'm not sure this cobalt building right here this main building i think we push into this right here all right one right here one dead yeah i'm looking around when he shoots on top i think i just killed him i can't tell if i killed him no i can't uh there's two on this roof at the

him max if we just hold that directions that was beautiful uh aka rocket launcher  here's a loot ender got from bradley by the way and after that we decided to add one more step to the game plan from the beginning step 4 give it all away so we built a fighting arena last one standing gets two rows of guns soft side two right here two rows of guns simon says turn back around i want you now not face the wall oh no no no no no one's dodging no one's trying to jump they're both oh double headshot no one's moving they're just going in wait wait let's keep it fifty fifth you start for somebody else

higher a little bit higher above the lid above the wood there you go there you go i killed one at the door pretty happy  so yeah that ray did not go too well kind of bummed us out because it was the first raid we lost that way we cheered ourselves up the only way we knew how there's a base here in q3 it's they're trying to build it big it's online are you sure it's online i'm on it i'm on it right now with a torch outside yeah that's them i think that's where they just came out of what's under where they lived  oh jeez wait there's windows doors open he's there there's okay okay uh two cctc brake pads bags so these guys are pretty new to the server and they didn't really have much we needed so we gave the base back oh street okay so listen listen you got to put a tc and them all listen listen no we unlock the door okay you got to put down the tc and break that floor that i put down okay like the two suits  that's our only entrance that's our only entrance front door doesn't matter no i'm sorry oh is there one on the other side i'm sorry why does every single person on the server sound the same they have a lot of same age  someone's going to get the one up on us so do we

lLTX5zYs7KM,Getting LOADED on FORCE WIPE! - Rust,3976,105,25,0 days 00:39:38,probably done what truly makes the wipe and rust complete is it killing everyone raiding everyone having the most loot because in my opinion i think we definitely completed our way wanna see how let's take it to the beginning we started our white by putting a base down and heading to underwater labs bye i go fish busted after this short loud run we headed home then went to harbor to get our first blue card where do we live t3 i see guys i got some sound if you think there's a problem nope heads up nope nope nope nope nope i can't tell which one's the push him geron went into the water i think he killed him yeah he didn't have anything 30 scrap 30 screw recycler turn it on go do the puzzle we went back home and got some recyclables he might have bled he didn't have any cloths on him there's a guy here he's at the container red container southeast two guys across the crossing they're circulating they're going right they're going southwest what was he doing i didn't get the tree there's two they're both here what are they doing i don't know we took all this loot back home and went back to harvard to fight like trying to hide inside hit one that one running on me he's two fighting me oh he hit me in the head real bad he's a little much easier i got two on me his group ended up being a five man which was a little bit too much for us to handle hit revo in the head i'm down monty or harvest horse underneath here he goes down revo's down okay i'm moving i put ammo on the chest oh my god they're chasing me hard i'm coming back i'm running towards the base as fast as i can chasing me he's naked naked with the revo outside the base  i got i still got four man right here right here come on three times on that one three times i'm gonna back up yeah draco don't stop giving no they're gonna back up the thing oh  i got back up yeah but i got no weapons i got looted where are you i'm coming oh my god three after that loss we had a surprise outside our base hey guys base one up 16. two guys outside five guys outside sits oh jesus christ oh my god seriously i'm inside he's looking at me he's arrowing what do you think their intentions are second one just came out now he's aiming at me well boys are we moving i mean if they're hyper aggressive they're gone by tomorrow but now we can't leave this base that's the problem uh bro you got twice our numbers don't even start talking bro yeah man you have more than twice you know what they say if you can't make it on the main come it's it's the first gun they've heard on white knight what do you think they're gonna no i don't want a 1v7 okay you want to show him the rocket launcher too while we're at it 1v7 go on a main server bro get off the server what are you doing okay i'm coming out we're heading yeah  who's the  now head shot he's chopping my bag what a  hell he's out hey whoa after this fight it was pretty quiet outside so we took this opportunity to farm some wood we need a shooting deck just so we can compound both so we made the decision to secrete their base while they weren't home it's the best thing that we could have done to get them out of the area because they were a little bit too close for comfort got it dude to go get some more components they were back at their base and they were ready to fight no they have one oh yeah dead okay come on twice i'm done no yes i'm picking you up no it was the other guy shot oh you probably brought up that was like perfect timing like i know my left all right thank you for your patronage meds he's in the water one's in the water here so take them out off this one after taking the majority of the gear sets they weren't really a problem for the time being so we crafted p2s and went to cargo something with the new update broke cargo so it was stuck at the top of the map not able to move so it'd be a great opportunity to get some free guns what's it doing that's a glitch do you think what if it just stays there dude oh my god what the give me back oh it is it is stuck up there let's go what do you mean thank you  it's like on those modded maps really dude no what is this do it together do it together we're getting shot from both sides get back here get back from then on it was just a standard cargo no one countered so i'm just going to show you the crates we got back one is still there i'm staying on top of matcha oh mp5 m39 i'm gonna come i got i got 25 i got 24 uh what kind of box what kind of box gave you that right that is  who wants f39 it's gonna be a at least either c4 rocket that's closer um maybe maybe expect something that's why i'm on there it's worth it's clunky but i kind of like it so i want to give it a chance why can't you do the pushing because you have to get out for me to push it oh oh i see okay sure sure i was just waiting for you to get on it we were going to take our new found guns to our neighbors but it seems like they already left that's how far goes down i would have blown them jesus look at all the bads one two three four five six seven was the seven man but they left food in the campfire you were right with dessert next to us gone we went out for a farming run we then went to some shots we heard a harbor oh dead   after that fight we went home and upgraded the base   with our roof bunker set up we went to meltons after eluding the inside we were met with some resistance while trying to leave squawking getting like one crate at a time okay twice two or three i don't know it's four four four times they're charging they're charging right side two of them i need good one nice it's sitting there charging  oh   damn it i'm just buddy  jesus count them there's two two up here one two three four five six uh probably seven there's two up here so i can't take any clothes after we won that fight we went back and threw two supply signals that we gathered so far now a flashlight because i can't see it or anything the wolf is attacking someone outside her base at there's lights on the air jobs now yeah yeah yeah no more no more sneaky looting them at nighttime here they come don't loot don't loot okay that's good damn oh that's not bad star grenades lots of ammo but it's not that bad i'll take two sides after looting both the air drops we went to subway and had a pretty standard run we recycled all the comps we got for scrap where is he now there's the gloves and several pants that's what i thought i just don't bring that bring it don't have  room for it a few moments later okay are you running is one of you going up the stairs by foot you guys might be familiar with the dude we met at the recycler possible hands up why would you make water yo a spoon guys it's spoon kid so yeah say come on we went back home upgraded our base and he builds a firing space after finishing up building we went out to labs a pedal on the right side you put on the left side left right left right left left yak kayak oh they're right here they're already there go to this moon pool they're already there you can look through the windows bro do you see anybody there's a jackie this is jackie apparently i can't damage him or something because this is just bugged oh no i got the one with the tommy oh good i can do it do i i think it was okay oh wait i don't have a water tank i i just i just murdered them it's okay okay i don't know i thought we're open it open it open it run through the rods we went back home but our neighbors started giving us a fight you killed these  you're in the butt it's b2 it's coming one by the water catcher's headshot twice i'm pushing  him up they're going for the base hit them three times four times reloading are you sure they're inside someone's done door's open doors open loot and leave what brand i'll drop a roof can't really rip this i don't care i can't i'm coming over let me see uh where's your boat i  hate ribs dude what where's your boat uh over there at the tip of the island we'll go get it after after we won that fight we went outside and secured some cc's and built a boat base after building outside our base we went to recycle and we got job near the there he is he's looking at me his rat suit right at the end of the pier north north north but there's another one i don't know where the other one went to scrap them this recycler did they jump off i have no way oh my god i'm dead i'm done made me jump item three times oh my god they're good insta they're gone after losing about 600 scrap at harbor we took our chance with this enough crate of course guys all these bases what he does yeah  oh he killed me i'm dead i didn't know that  he's still alive  i see him jumping hold on uh double headshot there's still a light on um yeah hold on i'm waiting for him to come down they're going up the rock where are they going up one's on the left  to immediately bounce back from this loss we went to cargo oh geez it's just not fair at all ran straight into them traded into two tommy guys they didn't even instacoming down to 32. there it is don't push the front so fast this is the second cargo in a row no one countered so let's just see those crates  wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait very good very good wait wait wait wait what is it oh i'm freezing okay okay okay wow it's like when there's guys on vpns and stuff put all this stuff in the crazy wait until we get like the sounds on we decided to go on one recycle run before we got off and this was not the best idea where did the other guy go there he is oh indeed dad jesus christ oh they're they're camping the recycler they're looting me yeah there's there's like a bunch i see him we ain't compound boat as well i'm dead i just got double compound boat we went back to the fight looked around the entire harbor the island could not find a trace of them we just lost about a thousand scrap or more the worst thing is that this is bp wipe the first day of bp wipe so a thousand scrap is a  so we started off day two by roaming and looking for possible raid targets there's a lot of shacks on the far side too the island now this garage door this guy popped up like really late last night we didn't see him when we walked off this boy knows what he's doing but he doesn't have um embracers i guess yet one door on one wall then you're in pretty close to the core what do you think we can hold this oh wait maybe not look at that you just go right here two garage doors yeah just pop this out no wait a minute where's the front door again front door is here if there's gonna be a war through it probably should do these guys though and then it's an up and a down and in here this next space we're looking at was the seven man from day one that we kicked out of the area river area too it's very very popular to make a nickname for our base like seven syllables yeah three river base seven syllables harvest doesn't like yeah cyrus doesn't like using letters he just grunts that's the base oh there's boots in here here we then went back home upgraded the base and built the compound um um  through the dvds and around the top of yo after finishing up the compound on the base we went out to raid some roof campers what are we doing what the  we went deep on that it's okay oh that bass below it uh yeah any traps what the hell they use ladders they moved they moved all the loot somewhere else dude oh my gosh i got a billy eyeless ad oh my god wait wait wait wait there's gotta be a tr it's gotta be a  um shotgun come here look at that it's wood soft no way i'm on it oh my god i have to break the this floor first oh we can't seriously what is this it just goes on uh some uh ladder okay hold on salvatore yes it's him don't kill him just let him die to the explosives i guess thank you all right we'll take a look oh my god he's got the  mask on kits next to nothing silencer red dot yay after not getting much from that raid he went to raid one of our juicier neighbors oh wait yeah we we should oh stone stone stone stone yeah you save a little bit if you do the stone down but what corner do you want to splash okay okay metal metal metal oh look in his hand what do you see what do

kxic62vpLaM,We Hosted SQUID GAME on an OFFICIAL RUST SERVER!,6135,141,26,0 days 00:12:01,so our wipe on a vanilla server was going insanely well so we decided to make a squid game inside of vanilla rust if you're not familiar with squid game in this case it's a series of five different challenges that players must win to get the grand prize 1000 scrap sometimes they work together sometimes it work individually it all changes based on the game in our case we played two different sets of squid games so there were two different victors i hope you like our take on it and i hope you enjoyed the video before we actually start i would like to put a big spoiler warning for the show because it includes a lot of the games that were in the show this first game was just like the show move when the light is off stop moving when the light is on and if you move you get killed game starting remember you have one minute to pass  do not touch the switch do not touch the switch i swear to god  good job good job good job come back inside come back inside everyone come back inside come back inside in this game they had to move water from one pool to the other without moving by passing the jug from one person to the other three two one hey good start good start okay okay cannot escape no no no no no  fill with water fill with all the water go with all the water no no no don't push it back okay okay that's right get back get back here with water okay 40 seconds 40 seconds okay you guys come over here come over here come over here well that's not my fault that you put him against the that you put him at the top are you standing there and watch the game you  fat ass  you you  no okay let's see let's see yeah he just moved he  moved hey hey no moving no moving at all  the judges are looking now okay um okay i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna consult with the judges i'm gonna consult with the judges okay what do you think do we do we just qualify them okay we had a minute he moved but he moved like away the other team was still way too slow just a transfer in the corner okay the ruling is it did not impact the game we're gonna go with it okay so fuji team you guys lost i'm sorry but i'm sorry the marbles game was pretty scuffed nobody died so i just decided not to keep it in because it was just pretty boring overall the next time you try to run something like this we'll definitely try to make it more exciting or at least try to eliminate more people with this game the fourth game was very similar to the show where there were eight pressure plates and if you stand on the wrong one it sets off a light and if the lights get set off you lose you'll start right see three two one started you got 60 seconds just go 60 seconds is this wired yeah just stand on and stand on these practice plate for three seconds get it in there man has died he stands he stepped on the first pressure go to the one on the left get on the one on the left first one on the left first okay you're good you're good go go go go left again okay you're good right you're right all right okay you're good you're right go right right go right we can switch it up  oh it's awesome ethan i think they got your stuff  monkey you knew which one it was loot awesome yeah the final game it's good game was native to korea so we thought of a game native to rust which was naked rock fighting three remember one two one go oh that's a great hit why you go for me oh you're out you're out he had my meds did he  yeah congratulations congratulations  you have one minute one minute what the  scratching me bro there's a cactus underneath it  i got  this dcr guy scares me he's like a robot he always stops uh ten seconds ten seconds seven six five  up four there you go let's go okay everyone back inside everyone back inside everyone back inside how many people guys you might want to watch if you don't understand okay uh  completely yes you cannot move at all cannot move at all the first guy moved a lot yeah yeah okay just keep dragging it in the pool no we're dead guys you lost anyways  starting in three two one sixty seconds stand on each pressure prep for three seconds you got you got 55 seconds 34 seconds colby did you miss the order call me did you miss the order i'm giving him 28 seconds oh no wait wait was that the only order uh yeah holy  i'm just so  up for a few seconds it might not be wrong better start moving oh it's not wired up bro okay we had some we had some technical difficulties it was not wired okay 60 seconds starting right now  crossfire you guys almost crossed us follow the king yes sir this guy has been here before yeah colby come on kilby look alive man look at that he's like he's doing his homework 30 uh 29 seconds hey they're killing each other inside hey they're killing each other inside there's someone with a bone eye remaining okay we changed the rules up for the second round of marbles so it was more interesting if they chose even and it landed on an odd number they lost that amount of marbles if they land on an even number then they gained that amount i'm taking three okay growth boy hotter even baby if all of you lose we don't have to give away scraps so hopefully all you do is but no look giving them my hands what do you say you're getting to my hands listen nobody pays attention to us they're just like trying to see if somebody dies goodbye   thank you for watching one of my first videos that i've actually put effort into on youtube i took a while but hopefully the effort showed off in the video thank you and goodbye,2021-10-18T11:14:02Z
